      "question": "On this pageHow to Apply to a Company ​Job hunting can often feel overwhelming, especially if you're just starting out or trying to make a significant career move. Over the years, I’ve learned a lot about what works—and what doesn’t—when applying for jobs, both as an applicant and a recruiter.In this post, I’ll share a step-by-step guide to help you navigate the process, from building a standout resume to preparing for interviews and handling job offers. Whether you’re a fresh graduate or someone looking to refine their approach, these tips are designed to make your journey smoother and more successful.It’s a detailed post, but I promise it’s worth your time. Let’s dive in!Step 0: Introductory Tasks ​Create a GitHub account if you don’t already have one (hopefully, everyone here does).Add a profile README like Tahmeed Vaiya’s GitHub.Upload your important projects to GitHub if you haven’t yet.Write a README for each repository. Most recruiters won’t run your code, so it’s better to include some kind of demo for your projects. This could be: Live websites, YouTube videos, Figma mockups, ScreenshotsBuild a simple personal website if you have time.Include details such as your achievements, education, experience, and other key information. The purpose of this website is to serve as an extension of your resume. Recruiters interested in knowing more about you might check out your website or GitHub.Create a LinkedIn account if you haven’t already.Try to keep it updated for at least the first 1–2 years of your professional life—you’ll thank me later!Step 1: Finding a company ​If the company visits BUET for a recruitment, then this is done.Otherwise, look for companies with open roles on LinkedIn. Almost all companies have a career page in their website. Go visit them time to time.Networking is the key. It is better to keep communication with your seniors to know when they have open roles. Many companies fill their vacancy through internal referral.Step 2: Finding the right role ​Identify the role that best matches your skills and interests. Carefully review the job description and assess their requirements. If you meet most of the requirements, you’re good to go.If you’re short on the minimum years of experience by 1–2 years, don’t worry—your time at BUET counts as relevant experience. It’s okay to miss a few of the preferred requirements as long as you meet the critical ones.Step 3: Background check ​Try to connect with someone from the company, ideally someone working in the role you’re applying for. Learn as much as you can about:The roleThe company cultureThe team you’ll potentially be working with.Remember, knowing is half the battle—this will help you confirm if the role is truly the right fit for you.Step 4: Resume preparation ​If I recall correctly, I’ve shared tips on resume building before. Regardless, here’s a comprehensive guide:Use a Template ​Avoid creating a resume from scratch; instead, use a tested template to save time and ensure quality. You can find excellent LaTeX templates like this one: GitHub: arasgungore-CV. For writing tips, refer to Indeed’s Guide on Technical Resumes.Keep It Concise ​Your resume shouldn’t be too long or too short—ideally, stick to one page. Avoid adding unnecessary details, like images.Key Sections to Include ​A good resume typically includes:Personal Information (Name, contact info, GitHub/LinkedIn links)ExperienceAchievementsProjectsSkillsEducationThesis (optional)Short Introduction (optional) Customize the order and skip sections if they aren’t relevant.Write Quantifiable Job Experience ​Highlight what you accomplished and its impact. Use a structure like: “Achieved X by doing Y, which resulted in Z% improvement.”Tailor your experience to align with the job requirements for each application. Example: Modify unrelated experiences to better match the role's responsibilities.Avoid adding irrelevant experiences unless you can frame them appropriately. For example: An experience in coaching can be presented positively if it demonstrates leadership or problem-solving skills.Showcase Projects Effectively ​Include at least three projects if you have no job experience. If you do have experience, include two significant projects to make room for your work history.Focus on:Problems solved or functionalities provided by the project.Tech stacks used, written concisely next to the project name (e.g., Project Name [React, Spring Boot]).Link to GitHub repositories and ensure your projects have well-written READMEs.Highlight Achievements ​When listing achievements, add context: If you ranked 5th, specify: “Ranked 5th out of 200 teams.”Percentiles are also impressive, e.g., “Ranked in the top 2% globally.”Review and Validate Your Resume ​Ask seniors or professionals (ideally someone from the company you’re applying to) to validate your resume. Remember, a great resume takes time to refine—it’s a process that evolves over a year or more.Additional Tips ​Avoid generic statements like:“I use React for frontend and Spring Boot with Hibernate for backend.” Instead, concisely include the stack next to your project title.Recruiters often spend less than a minute reviewing resumes, so focus on clarity and impact.Step 5: Preparing for the interviews ​The interview process often consists of several stages including automated psychometric test, coding round, technical test and live interviews which also has coding, technical and behavioral round.To prepare for coding rounds practice in leetcode. Try to solve all of the leetcode 150 problems even if they seem easy. Also see how others solve those problems. To prepare for technical round revise topics like OOP, DSA, Database, OS, Networking. System design related topic are a bit rare for freshers.Again, contact your seniors to learn more about the stages and question patterns.I actually compiled questions that we faced during our placement for juniors. Later others started contributing too. I will highly recommend to go through the site. It is my final gift to you. You can find the site link at https://github.com/TamimEhsan/interview-questions-bangladesh.Step 6: Final stage ​If you’re fortunate enough to secure multiple job offers, consider the following factors to make an informed decision: Salary and benefits, Location and commute. For example, I personally prefer a lower-paying job with an easier commute over a higher-paying one with a stressful commute.Most of the time you don’t need to negotiate your salary. However, it’s important to have realistic expectations and be prepared to justify them with valid reasons. Discuss your benefits, leaves, salary structure, bonuses, performace evaluation before you join any company. Remember, no company can force you to sign papers which prohibits you to stay for a x amount of time.Step 7: What if Things Don’t Work Out ​At first majority of you won’t get any placements right away. It will be even more frustrating when you will see that some of you are getting selected in multiple places. Do not create any conflicts for that. Avoid conflicts over this—it’s normal for candidates to choose what’s best for them. Once they make their choice, vacancies will open up for the next set of applicants.Don’t lose hope if you don’t find a job immediately. No one in BUET CSE remains unemployed for more than 3 months.If you’re still struggling reach out to your seniors for advice. Discuss areas where you might be lacking and identify ways to improve. Remember, you can always work on yourself and develop for the better.Final Note ​Best of luck to all of you! If you need help, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care.

It’s okay to miss a few of the preferred requirements as long as you meet the critical ones.Step 3: Background check ​Try to connect with someone from the company, ideally someone working in the role you’re applying for. Learn as much as you can about:The roleThe company cultureThe team you’ll potentially be working with.Remember, knowing is half the battle—this will help you confirm if the role is truly the right fit for you.Step 4: Resume preparation ​If I recall correctly, I’ve shared tips on resume building before. Regardless, here’s a comprehensive guide:Use a Template ​Avoid creating a resume from scratch; instead, use a tested template to save time and ensure quality. You can find excellent LaTeX templates like this one: GitHub: arasgungore-CV. For writing tips, refer to Indeed’s Guide on Technical Resumes.Keep It Concise ​Your resume shouldn’t be too long or too short—ideally, stick to one page. Avoid adding unnecessary details, like images.Key Sections to Include ​A good resume typically includes:Personal Information (Name, contact info, GitHub/LinkedIn links)ExperienceAchievementsProjectsSkillsEducationThesis (optional)Short Introduction (optional) Customize the order and skip sections if they aren’t relevant.Write Quantifiable Job Experience ​Highlight what you accomplished and its impact. Use a structure like: “Achieved X by doing Y, which resulted in Z% improvement.”Tailor your experience to align with the job requirements for each application. Example: Modify unrelated experiences to better match the role's responsibilities.Avoid adding irrelevant experiences unless you can frame them appropriately. For example: An experience in coaching can be presented positively if it demonstrates leadership or problem-solving skills.Showcase Projects Effectively ​Include at least three projects if you have no job experience. If you do have experience, include two significant projects to make room for your work history.Focus on:Problems solved or functionalities provided by the project.Tech stacks used, written concisely next to the project name (e.g., Project Name [React, Spring Boot]).Link to GitHub repositories and ensure your projects have well-written READMEs.Highlight Achievements ​When listing achievements, add context: If you ranked 5th, specify: “Ranked 5th out of 200 teams.”Percentiles are also impressive, e.g., “Ranked in the top 2% globally.”Review and Validate Your Resume ​Ask seniors or professionals (ideally someone from the company you’re applying to) to validate your resume. Remember, a great resume takes time to refine—it’s a process that evolves over a year or more.Additional Tips ​Avoid generic statements like:“I use React for frontend and Spring Boot with Hibernate for backend.” Instead, concisely include the stack next to your project title.Recruiters often spend less than a minute reviewing resumes, so focus on clarity and impact.Step 5: Preparing for the interviews ​The interview process often consists of several stages including automated psychometric test, coding round, technical test and live interviews which also has coding, technical and behavioral round.To prepare for coding rounds practice in leetcode. Try to solve all of the leetcode 150 problems even if they seem easy. Also see how others solve those problems. To prepare for technical round revise topics like OOP, DSA, Database, OS, Networking. System design related topic are a bit rare for freshers.Again, contact your seniors to learn more about the stages and question patterns.I actually compiled questions that we faced during our placement for juniors. Later others started contributing too. I will highly recommend to go through the site. It is my final gift to you. You can find the site link at https://github.com/TamimEhsan/interview-questions-bangladesh.Step 6: Final stage ​If you’re fortunate enough to secure multiple job offers, consider the following factors to make an informed decision: Salary and benefits, Location and commute. For example, I personally prefer a lower-paying job with an easier commute over a higher-paying one with a stressful commute.Most of the time you don’t need to negotiate your salary. However, it’s important to have realistic expectations and be prepared to justify them with valid reasons. Discuss your benefits, leaves, salary structure, bonuses, performace evaluation before you join any company. Remember, no company can force you to sign papers which prohibits you to stay for a x amount of time.Step 7: What if Things Don’t Work Out ​At first majority of you won’t get any placements right away. It will be even more frustrating when you will see that some of you are getting selected in multiple places. Do not create any conflicts for that. Avoid conflicts over this—it’s normal for candidates to choose what’s best for them. Once they make their choice, vacancies will open up for the next set of applicants.Don’t lose hope if you don’t find a job immediately. No one in BUET CSE remains unemployed for more than 3 months.If you’re still struggling reach out to your seniors for advice. Discuss areas where you might be lacking and identify ways to improve. Remember, you can always work on yourself and develop for the better.Final Note ​Best of luck to all of you! If you need help, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care.

      "question": "How to Apply to a Company ​Job hunting can often feel overwhelming, especially if you're just starting out or trying to make a significant career move. Over the years, I’ve learned a lot about what works—and what doesn’t—when applying for jobs, both as an applicant and a recruiter.In this post, I’ll share a step-by-step guide to help you navigate the process, from building a standout resume to preparing for interviews and handling job offers. Whether you’re a fresh graduate or someone looking to refine their approach, these tips are designed to make your journey smoother and more successful.It’s a detailed post, but I promise it’s worth your time. Let’s dive in!Step 0: Introductory Tasks ​Create a GitHub account if you don’t already have one (hopefully, everyone here does).Add a profile README like Tahmeed Vaiya’s GitHub.Upload your important projects to GitHub if you haven’t yet.Write a README for each repository. Most recruiters won’t run your code, so it’s better to include some kind of demo for your projects. This could be: Live websites, YouTube videos, Figma mockups, ScreenshotsBuild a simple personal website if you have time.Include details such as your achievements, education, experience, and other key information. The purpose of this website is to serve as an extension of your resume. Recruiters interested in knowing more about you might check out your website or GitHub.Create a LinkedIn account if you haven’t already.Try to keep it updated for at least the first 1–2 years of your professional life—you’ll thank me later!Step 1: Finding a company ​If the company visits BUET for a recruitment, then this is done.Otherwise, look for companies with open roles on LinkedIn. Almost all companies have a career page in their website. Go visit them time to time.Networking is the key. It is better to keep communication with your seniors to know when they have open roles. Many companies fill their vacancy through internal referral.Step 2: Finding the right role ​Identify the role that best matches your skills and interests. Carefully review the job description and assess their requirements. If you meet most of the requirements, you’re good to go.If you’re short on the minimum years of experience by 1–2 years, don’t worry—your time at BUET counts as relevant experience. It’s okay to miss a few of the preferred requirements as long as you meet the critical ones.Step 3: Background check ​Try to connect with someone from the company, ideally someone working in the role you’re applying for.

A stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, which is suitable for maintaining the browsing history.In the following code snippet, what does the keyword 'this' refer tojavaclass Employee {\n    private String name;\n        public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n}Show AnswerThe keyword 'this' refers to the current instance of the class. In this context, 'this.name' refers to the instance variable 'name' of the current Employee object.In a bag , there is black and red balls. The ratio of black to red is 3:7 , if we add 20 more black balls to the bag then the ratio becomes 1:2. How many red balls are there?Show AnswerLet the number of black balls be 3x and the number of red balls be 7x. After adding 20 more black balls, the ratio becomes 1:2. So, the number of black balls is 3x + 20 and the number of red balls is 7x. According to the given condition, (3x + 20) / 7x = 1 / 2. Solving this equation, we get x = 40. Therefore, the number of red balls is 7x = 280.which of the following is false about RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)?RDBMS supports concurrency control to handle multiple transactions simultaneously.RDBMS uses tables to store data in rows and columns.In RDBMS, a unique constraint prevents null values in a column.RDBMS ensures data integrity using ACID properties.Show AnswerThe false statement about RDBMS is: In RDBMS, a unique constraint prevents null values in a column. A unique constraint ensures that all values in a column are unique, but it does not prevent null values.A train leaves station A at 7 AM with the speed of 60 kmph, and another train leaves the A station at 8 AM with the speed of 90 kmph..when will the second train catch the first train?The first train is already 60 km ahead and the second train is faster, so we calculate the relative speed: Relative Speed = Speed of Second Train − Speed of First Train = 90km/h − 60km/h = 30km/h Time = Distance / Relative Speed = 60km / 30km/h ​= 2hours Final answer = 8:00AM + 2hours = 10:00AM The second train will catch the first train at 10 AMWhat will be the output of the following code?cpp#include <stdio.h>\nint main() {\n    int sum = 7 + 6 / 3 + 14 * 2;\n    printf(\"%d\", sum);\n    return 0;\n}Show AnswerDivision and multiplication have higher precedence than addition.

The Agile methodology is a project management approach that involves breaking the project into phases and emphasizes continuous collaboration and improvement. Teams follow a cycle of planning, executing, and evaluating.Who is most likely to write unit tests in a software development project?Show AnswerDevelopers are responsible for writing unit tests to ensure that individual units of code are functioning correctly. Unit tests are typically written to test the functionality of the code.Once upon a time, a group of detectives were presented with a challenge to identify which of the 1000 candies was poisoned before it caused harm to any living species. They had to act fast, as the poison would take effect within an hour of consumption. The detectives knew they could use test subjects, but they needed to determine the minimum number required to solve the mystery in time. Can you help them find the solution before it's too late?In the Agile Model, what is the primary purpose of a \"sprint\"?Show AnswerIn Agile methodology, a \"sprint\" is a short, time-boxed period where a team focuses on completing a specific set of work, essentially a dedicated cycle within a project where a defined amount of functionality is developed and ready for review.What does the static keyword mean when used with a method?Show AnswerWhen the static keyword is used with a method, it means that the method belongs to the class itself rather than an instance of the class. Static methods can be called without creating an instance of the class. When we declare a field static, exactly a single copy of that field is created and shared among all instances of that class. Similar to static fields, static methods also belong to a class instead of an object. So, we can invoke them without instantiating the class.Why are immutable objects often preferred in OOP design?Show AnswerImmutable objects are often preferred in OOP design because they are thread-safe, meaning they can be shared between multiple threads without the risk of data corruption. Additionally, immutable objects are easier to reason about and can help prevent bugs related to mutable state changes.You are given an undirected graph with weighted edges.

Some sample questions from Java are given.What is primitive and non primitive data types? How are they different? When can their values be changed?Why are strings immutable in Java?What are the 4 principles of OOP?What is diamond problem?Show Answer Diamond Problem is a problem faced during Multiple Inheritance in Java. This problem occurs when a class inherits from two interfaces that both extend a common interface and define a method with the same name. The ambiguity arises because the class implementing these interfaces does not know which method to call when invoking the method by name.Does Java support multiple inheritence?Show AnswerJava doesn't allow multiple inheritance to avoid the complexity and ambiguity associated with it, particularly the \"diamond problem,\" where a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor, leading to conflicts in the inheritance of methods.Read more from Diamonds Aren’t a Developer’s Best Friend: Tackling the Diamond Problem in JavaHow does Java tackle the multiple inheritence issue?Show AnswerJava doesn't allow multiple inheritance to avoid the complexity and ambiguity associated with it, particularly the \"diamond problem,\" where a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor, leading to conflicts in the inheritance of methods.To resolve this ambiguity, you must override the conflicting method in the implementing class and explicitly specify which method you want to use.javainterface A {\n    default void foo() {\n        System.out.println(\"A's foo\");\n    }\n}\n\ninterface B extends A {\n    default void foo() {\n        System.out.println(\"B's foo\");\n    }\n}\n\ninterface C extends A {\n    default void foo() {\n        System.out.println(\"C's foo\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass D implements B, C {\n    @Override\n    public void foo() {\n        B.super.foo(); // or C.super.foo();\n    }\n    \n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        D d = new D();\n        d.foo();\n    }\n}In this example, the foo method is overridden in class D, and within the overridden method, we explicitly call the foomethod from either B or C using B.super.foo() or C.super.foo().What features of Spring Boot have you used?What is indexing in Database?Describe ACID in RDBMSShow AnswerACID is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. Databases that support this are called ACID compliance. The properties areAtomicity: Each statement in a transaction (to read, write, update or delete data) is treated as a single unit. Either the entire statement is executed, or none of it is executed.Consistency: Ensures the databases remain consistent following some predefined business logic both before and after the transactionIsolation: Each transaction executes in such a way that one is not affected by other s though they were occurring only one.Durability: The data changes by a successfull transaction is saved even in the event of system failureIMPORTANTAtomicity, isolation and durability are properties of the database, whereas consistency is a property of the application. The C in ACID was tossed in to make the acronym work. [ref: Martin Kleppmann, Designing Data Intensive Applications]Some questions might be asked from the projects added in resume.

In this context, 'this.name' refers to the instance variable 'name' of the current Employee object.In a bag , there is black and red balls. The ratio of black to red is 3:7 , if we add 20 more black balls to the bag then the ratio becomes 1:2. How many red balls are there?Show AnswerLet the number of black balls be 3x and the number of red balls be 7x. After adding 20 more black balls, the ratio becomes 1:2. So, the number of black balls is 3x + 20 and the number of red balls is 7x. According to the given condition, (3x + 20) / 7x = 1 / 2. Solving this equation, we get x = 40. Therefore, the number of red balls is 7x = 280.which of the following is false about RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)?RDBMS supports concurrency control to handle multiple transactions simultaneously.RDBMS uses tables to store data in rows and columns.In RDBMS, a unique constraint prevents null values in a column.RDBMS ensures data integrity using ACID properties.Show AnswerThe false statement about RDBMS is: In RDBMS, a unique constraint prevents null values in a column. A unique constraint ensures that all values in a column are unique, but it does not prevent null values.A train leaves station A at 7 AM with the speed of 60 kmph, and another train leaves the A station at 8 AM with the speed of 90 kmph..when will the second train catch the first train?The first train is already 60 km ahead and the second train is faster, so we calculate the relative speed: Relative Speed = Speed of Second Train − Speed of First Train = 90km/h − 60km/h = 30km/h Time = Distance / Relative Speed = 60km / 30km/h ​= 2hours Final answer = 8:00AM + 2hours = 10:00AM The second train will catch the first train at 10 AMWhat will be the output of the following code?cpp#include <stdio.h>\nint main() {\n    int sum = 7 + 6 / 3 + 14 * 2;\n    printf(\"%d\", sum);\n    return 0;\n}Show AnswerDivision and multiplication have higher precedence than addition.

The Agile methodology is a project management approach that involves breaking the project into phases and emphasizes continuous collaboration and improvement. Teams follow a cycle of planning, executing, and evaluating.Who is most likely to write unit tests in a software development project?Show AnswerDevelopers are responsible for writing unit tests to ensure that individual units of code are functioning correctly. Unit tests are typically written to test the functionality of the code.Once upon a time, a group of detectives were presented with a challenge to identify which of the 1000 candies was poisoned before it caused harm to any living species. They had to act fast, as the poison would take effect within an hour of consumption. The detectives knew they could use test subjects, but they needed to determine the minimum number required to solve the mystery in time. Can you help them find the solution before it's too late?In the Agile Model, what is the primary purpose of a \"sprint\"?Show AnswerIn Agile methodology, a \"sprint\" is a short, time-boxed period where a team focuses on completing a specific set of work, essentially a dedicated cycle within a project where a defined amount of functionality is developed and ready for review.What does the static keyword mean when used with a method?Show AnswerWhen the static keyword is used with a method, it means that the method belongs to the class itself rather than an instance of the class. Static methods can be called without creating an instance of the class. When we declare a field static, exactly a single copy of that field is created and shared among all instances of that class. Similar to static fields, static methods also belong to a class instead of an object. So, we can invoke them without instantiating the class.Why are immutable objects often preferred in OOP design?Show AnswerImmutable objects are often preferred in OOP design because they are thread-safe, meaning they can be shared between multiple threads without the risk of data corruption. Additionally, immutable objects are easier to reason about and can help prevent bugs related to mutable state changes.You are given an undirected graph with weighted edges. Which algorithm would you use to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)?Show AnswerWe can use Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of an undirected graph with weighted edges.What is the time complexity of searching for an element in a balanced binary search tree?Show AnswerThe time complexity of searching for an element in a balanced binary search tree is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.There are 100 light bulbs and 100 people. Initially, all bulbs are off. Person 1 flips every bulb (1, 2, 3, 4, …). Person 2 flips every 2nd bulb (2, 4, 6, …). Person 3 flips every 3rd bulb (3, 6, 9, …), and so on, until all 100 people have acted. How many people would have flipped bulb number 72?Show AnswerWe need to find the factors of 72 to determine how many people would have flipped bulb number 72. The factors of 72 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72. Therefore, 12 people would have flipped bulb number 72.A circular queue has a size of 5 and currently contains 3 elements. How many more elements can you insert?Show AnswerWe can insert 2 more elements into the circular queue, as it has a size of 5 and currently contains 3 elements.You are given the head of a circular singly linked list and an integer n. How would you remove the nth node from the end of the list efficiently?Show Hint Use the two-pointer technique. Show AnswerUse two pointer; fast and slow. Move the fast pointer n steps ahead, then move both fast and slow until fast reaches the last node. Delete slow->next by updating slow->next = slow->next->next. Handle edge cases separately.You are working with a binary search tree (BST) and need to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes, u and v. Which of the following is the most efficient approach for finding the LCA in a BST, assuming no additional balancing is applied?Show AnswerThe most efficient approach is to traverse the BST from the root, moving left if both u and v are smaller, right if both are larger, and stopping when the current node is between u and v (i.e., the LCA). Time Complexity: O(h), where h is the tree height. Provided the tree is balanced, the height is log(n).What is the next term in the series: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, __?Show AnswerThe next term in the series is 36. The series represents the squares of natural numbers: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2.In a many-to-many relationship between two database tables, which of the following is typically used to model the relationship?Given a code, you have to determine which OOP features is not used in the code above?Which of the option in a given list is NOT a valid SQL data type?Given a list of statements, which of them is false for dynamic programming?A game development team is working on a character system where all characters have a fight() method. Characters like Warrior, Mage, and Archer implement this method differently. Which concept ensures the correct method is executed based on the character type?Show AnswerThe concept of polymorphism ensures the correct method is executed based on the character type. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.Read more about Java Polymorphism | W3 SchoolsGiven a list of situations, In which of them would a stack be most appropriate?In a network of cities and roads, you are given n cities and m roads between them. Your task is to determine the minimum number of new roads required to ensure that there is a path between every pair of cities.

They are presented with multiple tasks throughout the day. Most important of them areWritten ExamProject Planning and PresentationInterviewWritten Exam ​The written exam have 3 segmentsBehavioural TestAptitude TestTechnical TestIt is taken first thing in the morning. Some of them are taken in sheet of papers and some are taken in external or internal websites.Behavioural Test ​The behavioural tests are quite similar to the ones standardized by Amazon. The situational judgment test (SJT) or behavioral assessment stage evaluates a candidate's decision-making and problem-solving skills in workplace scenarios. Candidates are presented with a situation and two possible responses, selecting their preference on a scale from strongly favoring one option to neutral or favoring the other. This helps employers assess traits like leadership, teamwork, and customer focus. Companies like Amazon use this method to identify candidates who align with their core values and work culture.A customer reaches out with a complaint about a product they purchased.

These tests are commonly used in hiring to evaluate a candidate's ability to think critically and process information efficiently. They are often timed and include questions on math, logic, patterns, and language. These tests are written or MCQ type questions. On average there are 30 questions like these.If you had to choose 1 food to eat for the rest of your life, then what would it be? why?Which actor do you like the most? why?When do you feel sad the most?Technical Test ​This test is language dependent. You'll be asked to chose a language eg Java, JavaScript, Python etc and the questions will be based on that language. There are about 15 questions in this test. The topics are from core language features, loop, time complexity, data structures, algorithm etc.Give a description about your favourite projectProject Planning and Presentation ​One of the tasks is to come up with a solution for a given scenario. The candidates are divided into groups and each group is assigned a mentor. The mentor will guide the group throughout the task. The groups need to present their solution at the end of the day. The presentation includes ERD, wireframe, SQL etc. Each one of the group members needs to present a part of the solution.Create presentations on a ticket management systemShow DescriptionYou are to design a system for a ticket management system. There are multiple employees in the system; admin, ticket master, cashier, checker, user. Each employee has different roles. For example, the ticker master can issue tickets. He can also edit or delete a ticket allocation. The cashier collects payment for the tickets. He can also issue ticket. The checker only checks the validity of the tickets. There can be multiple type of tickets based on the seat. Admin can create new type of tickets in the system. An user buys ticket from the system.Show DeliverablesThe candidates are to presentProject Requirement AnalysisDatabase Schema DesignClass DiagramSQL for some specific queries Each team is given a big presentation paper.

Some sample questions from Java are given.What is primitive and non primitive data types? How are they different? When can their values be changed?Why are strings immutable in Java?What are the 4 principles of OOP?What is diamond problem?Show Answer Diamond Problem is a problem faced during Multiple Inheritance in Java. This problem occurs when a class inherits from two interfaces that both extend a common interface and define a method with the same name. The ambiguity arises because the class implementing these interfaces does not know which method to call when invoking the method by name.Does Java support multiple inheritence?Show AnswerJava doesn't allow multiple inheritance to avoid the complexity and ambiguity associated with it, particularly the \"diamond problem,\" where a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor, leading to conflicts in the inheritance of methods.Read more from Diamonds Aren’t a Developer’s Best Friend: Tackling the Diamond Problem in JavaHow does Java tackle the multiple inheritence issue?Show AnswerJava doesn't allow multiple inheritance to avoid the complexity and ambiguity associated with it, particularly the \"diamond problem,\" where a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor, leading to conflicts in the inheritance of methods.To resolve this ambiguity, you must override the conflicting method in the implementing class and explicitly specify which method you want to use.javainterface A {\n    default void foo() {\n        System.out.println(\"A's foo\");\n    }\n}\n\ninterface B extends A {\n    default void foo() {\n        System.out.println(\"B's foo\");\n    }\n}\n\ninterface C extends A {\n    default void foo() {\n        System.out.println(\"C's foo\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass D implements B, C {\n    @Override\n    public void foo() {\n        B.super.foo(); // or C.super.foo();\n    }\n    \n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        D d = new D();\n        d.foo();\n    }\n}In this example, the foo method is overridden in class D, and within the overridden method, we explicitly call the foomethod from either B or C using B.super.foo() or C.super.foo().What features of Spring Boot have you used?What is indexing in Database?Describe ACID in RDBMSShow AnswerACID is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. Databases that support this are called ACID compliance. The properties areAtomicity: Each statement in a transaction (to read, write, update or delete data) is treated as a single unit. Either the entire statement is executed, or none of it is executed.Consistency: Ensures the databases remain consistent following some predefined business logic both before and after the transactionIsolation: Each transaction executes in such a way that one is not affected by other s though they were occurring only one.Durability: The data changes by a successfull transaction is saved even in the event of system failureIMPORTANTAtomicity, isolation and durability are properties of the database, whereas consistency is a property of the application. The C in ACID was tossed in to make the acronym work. [ref: Martin Kleppmann, Designing Data Intensive Applications]Some questions might be asked from the projects added in resume.

Now he is analyzing requirements for the navigation system of his web browser, which will preserve the browsing history. What is the appropriate data structure to use for the navigation system?Show AnswerThe appropriate data structure to use for the navigation system of a web browser is a Stack. A stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, which is suitable for maintaining the browsing history.In the following code snippet, what does the keyword 'this' refer tojavaclass Employee {\n    private String name;\n        public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n}Show AnswerThe keyword 'this' refers to the current instance of the class. In this context, 'this.name' refers to the instance variable 'name' of the current Employee object.In a bag , there is black and red balls. The ratio of black to red is 3:7 , if we add 20 more black balls to the bag then the ratio becomes 1:2. How many red balls are there?Show AnswerLet the number of black balls be 3x and the number of red balls be 7x. After adding 20 more black balls, the ratio becomes 1:2. So, the number of black balls is 3x + 20 and the number of red balls is 7x. According to the given condition, (3x + 20) / 7x = 1 / 2. Solving this equation, we get x = 40. Therefore, the number of red balls is 7x = 280.which of the following is false about RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)?RDBMS supports concurrency control to handle multiple transactions simultaneously.RDBMS uses tables to store data in rows and columns.In RDBMS, a unique constraint prevents null values in a column.RDBMS ensures data integrity using ACID properties.Show AnswerThe false statement about RDBMS is: In RDBMS, a unique constraint prevents null values in a column. A unique constraint ensures that all values in a column are unique, but it does not prevent null values.A train leaves station A at 7 AM with the speed of 60 kmph, and another train leaves the A station at 8 AM with the speed of 90 kmph..when will the second train catch the first train?The first train is already 60 km ahead and the second train is faster, so we calculate the relative speed: Relative Speed = Speed of Second Train − Speed of First Train = 90km/h − 60km/h = 30km/h Time = Distance / Relative Speed = 60km / 30km/h ​= 2hours Final answer = 8:00AM + 2hours = 10:00AM The second train will catch the first train at 10 AMWhat will be the output of the following code?cpp#include <stdio.h>\nint main() {\n    int sum = 7 + 6 / 3 + 14 * 2;\n    printf(\"%d\", sum);\n    return 0;\n}Show AnswerDivision and multiplication have higher precedence than addition.

The Agile methodology is a project management approach that involves breaking the project into phases and emphasizes continuous collaboration and improvement. Teams follow a cycle of planning, executing, and evaluating.Who is most likely to write unit tests in a software development project?Show AnswerDevelopers are responsible for writing unit tests to ensure that individual units of code are functioning correctly. Unit tests are typically written to test the functionality of the code.Once upon a time, a group of detectives were presented with a challenge to identify which of the 1000 candies was poisoned before it caused harm to any living species. They had to act fast, as the poison would take effect within an hour of consumption. The detectives knew they could use test subjects, but they needed to determine the minimum number required to solve the mystery in time. Can you help them find the solution before it's too late?In the Agile Model, what is the primary purpose of a \"sprint\"?Show AnswerIn Agile methodology, a \"sprint\" is a short, time-boxed period where a team focuses on completing a specific set of work, essentially a dedicated cycle within a project where a defined amount of functionality is developed and ready for review.What does the static keyword mean when used with a method?Show AnswerWhen the static keyword is used with a method, it means that the method belongs to the class itself rather than an instance of the class. Static methods can be called without creating an instance of the class. When we declare a field static, exactly a single copy of that field is created and shared among all instances of that class. Similar to static fields, static methods also belong to a class instead of an object. So, we can invoke them without instantiating the class.Why are immutable objects often preferred in OOP design?Show AnswerImmutable objects are often preferred in OOP design because they are thread-safe, meaning they can be shared between multiple threads without the risk of data corruption. Additionally, immutable objects are easier to reason about and can help prevent bugs related to mutable state changes.You are given an undirected graph with weighted edges. Which algorithm would you use to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)?Show AnswerWe can use Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of an undirected graph with weighted edges.What is the time complexity of searching for an element in a balanced binary search tree?Show AnswerThe time complexity of searching for an element in a balanced binary search tree is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.There are 100 light bulbs and 100 people. Initially, all bulbs are off. Person 1 flips every bulb (1, 2, 3, 4, …). Person 2 flips every 2nd bulb (2, 4, 6, …). Person 3 flips every 3rd bulb (3, 6, 9, …), and so on, until all 100 people have acted. How many people would have flipped bulb number 72?Show AnswerWe need to find the factors of 72 to determine how many people would have flipped bulb number 72. The factors of 72 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72. Therefore, 12 people would have flipped bulb number 72.A circular queue has a size of 5 and currently contains 3 elements. How many more elements can you insert?Show AnswerWe can insert 2 more elements into the circular queue, as it has a size of 5 and currently contains 3 elements.You are given the head of a circular singly linked list and an integer n. How would you remove the nth node from the end of the list efficiently?Show Hint Use the two-pointer technique. Show AnswerUse two pointer; fast and slow. Move the fast pointer n steps ahead, then move both fast and slow until fast reaches the last node. Delete slow->next by updating slow->next = slow->next->next. Handle edge cases separately.You are working with a binary search tree (BST) and need to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes, u and v. Which of the following is the most efficient approach for finding the LCA in a BST, assuming no additional balancing is applied?Show AnswerThe most efficient approach is to traverse the BST from the root, moving left if both u and v are smaller, right if both are larger, and stopping when the current node is between u and v (i.e., the LCA). Time Complexity: O(h), where h is the tree height. Provided the tree is balanced, the height is log(n).What is the next term in the series: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, __?Show AnswerThe next term in the series is 36. The series represents the squares of natural numbers: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2.In a many-to-many relationship between two database tables, which of the following is typically used to model the relationship?Given a code, you have to determine which OOP features is not used in the code above?Which of the option in a given list is NOT a valid SQL data type?Given a list of statements, which of them is false for dynamic programming?A game development team is working on a character system where all characters have a fight() method. Characters like Warrior, Mage, and Archer implement this method differently. Which concept ensures the correct method is executed based on the character type?Show AnswerThe concept of polymorphism ensures the correct method is executed based on the character type. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.Read more about Java Polymorphism | W3 SchoolsGiven a list of situations, In which of them would a stack be most appropriate?In a network of cities and roads, you are given n cities and m roads between them. Your task is to determine the minimum number of new roads required to ensure that there is a path between every pair of cities. What is the most suitable approach to solve this problem?Show AnswerThe most suitable approach is to create a connected graph using a Union-Find algorithm. The cities will be connected in multiple components. Each city in a component is connected to any other city in the same component using some series of roads. The minimum number of new roads required is the number of components minus one.Given a graph in figure, What is the shortest path from a point A to point F using BFS?Given a list of examples, which of them is an example of compile-time polymorphism?Show AnswerFunction overloading is an example of compile-time polymorphism. It allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameters to be defined in a class.You are given a list of n unique room numbers belonging to guests at a hotel. These numbers are in the range [0, n], but one guest's room number is missing from the list. What is the best possible space complexity for solving this problem?Show AnswerThe best possible space complexity is O(1). We can use the XOR operation to find the missing room number without using additional space. XOR all the room numbers in a variable x. Then XOR x with the range [0, n] and the missing room number will be the result.Identify the What type of casting is demonstrated in a code segment?Given some figures of graph, identify which is not a bipartite graph?Show AnswerA bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent. A graph that contains an odd-length cycle is not a bipartite graph.What is the purpose of the final keyword in OOP?Show AnswerThe final keyword in OOP is used to restrict the user. It can be used with variables, methods, and classes. When a variable is declared with the final keyword, its value cannot be changed. When a method is declared with the final keyword, it cannot be overridden by subclasses. When a class is declared. with the final keyword, it cannot be subclassed.Write a SQL query to retrieve the names of all customers who have placed an order with a total value greater than $1000.

They are presented with multiple tasks throughout the day. Most important of them areWritten ExamProject Planning and PresentationInterviewWritten Exam ​The written exam have 3 segmentsBehavioural TestAptitude TestTechnical TestIt is taken first thing in the morning. Some of them are taken in sheet of papers and some are taken in external or internal websites.Behavioural Test ​The behavioural tests are quite similar to the ones standardized by Amazon. The situational judgment test (SJT) or behavioral assessment stage evaluates a candidate's decision-making and problem-solving skills in workplace scenarios. Candidates are presented with a situation and two possible responses, selecting their preference on a scale from strongly favoring one option to neutral or favoring the other. This helps employers assess traits like leadership, teamwork, and customer focus. Companies like Amazon use this method to identify candidates who align with their core values and work culture.A customer reaches out with a complaint about a product they purchased. They are clearly frustrated, but the issue falls outside the company’s usual return policy.Show OptionsOptions: A) Stick to company policy and explain why you can’t help them. B) Make an exception to satisfy the customer.Scale: 1️⃣ Strongly Prefer A 2️⃣ Moderately Prefer A 3️⃣ Neutral 4️⃣ Moderately Prefer B 5️⃣ Strongly Prefer BA customer reaches out with a complaint about a product they purchased.

B) Insist on discussing the approach further before moving forward.Scale: 1️⃣ Strongly Prefer A 2️⃣ Moderately Prefer A 3️⃣ Neutral 4️⃣ Moderately Prefer B 5️⃣ Strongly Prefer BAptitude Test ​Aptitude tests assess a candidate’s problem-solving ability, logical reasoning, numerical skills, and verbal comprehension. These tests are commonly used in hiring to evaluate a candidate's ability to think critically and process information efficiently. They are often timed and include questions on math, logic, patterns, and language. These tests are written or MCQ type questions. On average there are 30 questions like these.If you had to choose 1 food to eat for the rest of your life, then what would it be? why?Which actor do you like the most? why?When do you feel sad the most?Technical Test ​This test is language dependent. You'll be asked to chose a language eg Java, JavaScript, Python etc and the questions will be based on that language. There are about 15 questions in this test. The topics are from core language features, loop, time complexity, data structures, algorithm etc.Give a description about your favourite projectProject Planning and Presentation ​One of the tasks is to come up with a solution for a given scenario. The candidates are divided into groups and each group is assigned a mentor. The mentor will guide the group throughout the task. The groups need to present their solution at the end of the day. The presentation includes ERD, wireframe, SQL etc. Each one of the group members needs to present a part of the solution.Create presentations on a ticket management systemShow DescriptionYou are to design a system for a ticket management system. There are multiple employees in the system; admin, ticket master, cashier, checker, user. Each employee has different roles. For example, the ticker master can issue tickets. He can also edit or delete a ticket allocation. The cashier collects payment for the tickets. He can also issue ticket. The checker only checks the validity of the tickets. There can be multiple type of tickets based on the seat. Admin can create new type of tickets in the system. An user buys ticket from the system.Show DeliverablesThe candidates are to presentProject Requirement AnalysisDatabase Schema DesignClass DiagramSQL for some specific queries Each team is given a big presentation paper. They will need to present the whole system within that paper. Individual Interview ​Each candidate faces yet another interview at the end of the day. This stage is language independent and focues on general software development knowledges. Topics might include git, SDLC, data structures, algorithm etc.Some situations are given, you'll need to provide which algoritm is best suited for solving the task.Given some code, you'll need to figure out the time complexity of the codeProject Submission ​This round is not present in the Star Coder program every year. But in some years, candidates are asked to submit a project. A scenario is given to the candidates through email. The project is chosen based on the candidates preferences presented in the previous rounds. The project is to be submitted within a week. The projects given are pretty basic, but the candidates are expected to follow best practices.A sample project scenario is given below:Create a simple system for a task management system.RequirementsAuthentication ​User can sign upUser can sign inTask Management ​User can create a taskUser can update a taskUser can delete a taskUser can view all tasks created by himBest practicesRestful API ​Follow the RESTful API guidelinesUse proper status codesAll the endpoints should be documentedData validation ​Use proper error handlingAll the endpoints request should be validatedDatabase ​Use a relational database to store the dataUse ORM to interact with the databaseTesting ​Write unit tests for the core logicsHandle both positive and negative test casesAuthentication ​Use JWT for authenticationUse RBAC to manage the rolesSecurity ​Store the password in a hashed formatUse proper sanitization to prevent SQL injectionSanite user input to prevent XSS attackImplement CSRF protectionBonusImplement additional features like pagination, search, filtering etcEvaluationThe project will be evaluated based on the best practices followed, code quality, and the features implementedCorrectness and functionality of the systemCode qualityRESTful API guidelinesSecurity measuresAuthentication and authorizationFrontend integrationDocumentationTestingBonus featuresDeliverablesCodebase ​Use version control to manage the codebase. The codebase should be hosted in a public repository.Documentation ​Provide a README file with setup instructions, API documentation, and any other necessary information.Tests ​Write unit tests for the core logics. Add instructions on how to run the tests.Technical Round ​This round is also language and stack specific. The language is chosen by the candidate during the day long assessment. Some sample questions from Java are given.What is primitive and non primitive data types? How are they different? When can their values be changed?Why are strings immutable in Java?What are the 4 principles of OOP?What is diamond problem?Show Answer Diamond Problem is a problem faced during Multiple Inheritance in Java. This problem occurs when a class inherits from two interfaces that both extend a common interface and define a method with the same name. The ambiguity arises because the class implementing these interfaces does not know which method to call when invoking the method by name.Does Java support multiple inheritence?Show AnswerJava doesn't allow multiple inheritance to avoid the complexity and ambiguity associated with it, particularly the \"diamond problem,\" where a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor, leading to conflicts in the inheritance of methods.Read more from Diamonds Aren’t a Developer’s Best Friend: Tackling the Diamond Problem in JavaHow does Java tackle the multiple inheritence issue?Show AnswerJava doesn't allow multiple inheritance to avoid the complexity and ambiguity associated with it, particularly the \"diamond problem,\" where a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor, leading to conflicts in the inheritance of methods.To resolve this ambiguity, you must override the conflicting method in the implementing class and explicitly specify which method you want to use.javainterface A {\n    default void foo() {\n        System.out.println(\"A's foo\");\n    }\n}\n\ninterface B extends A {\n    default void foo() {\n        System.out.println(\"B's foo\");\n    }\n}\n\ninterface C extends A {\n    default void foo() {\n        System.out.println(\"C's foo\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass D implements B, C {\n    @Override\n    public void foo() {\n        B.super.foo(); // or C.super.foo();\n    }\n    \n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        D d = new D();\n        d.foo();\n    }\n}In this example, the foo method is overridden in class D, and within the overridden method, we explicitly call the foomethod from either B or C using B.super.foo() or C.super.foo().What features of Spring Boot have you used?What is indexing in Database?Describe ACID in RDBMSShow AnswerACID is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. Databases that support this are called ACID compliance. The properties areAtomicity: Each statement in a transaction (to read, write, update or delete data) is treated as a single unit. Either the entire statement is executed, or none of it is executed.Consistency: Ensures the databases remain consistent following some predefined business logic both before and after the transactionIsolation: Each transaction executes in such a way that one is not affected by other s though they were occurring only one.Durability: The data changes by a successfull transaction is saved even in the event of system failureIMPORTANTAtomicity, isolation and durability are properties of the database, whereas consistency is a property of the application. The C in ACID was tossed in to make the acronym work. [ref: Martin Kleppmann, Designing Data Intensive Applications]Some questions might be asked from the projects added in resume. If github repository links are added then interviewer might check those out too.Suppose you have to build a e-commerce site where you have multiple product listing. In the home page the products have some small information listed. When you click on any single product then full details of the product is shown. How would you design the database and system for this?",

They have been successfully providing software services since 2018 in both the local and global market.Interview Stages ​For the Trainee Software Engineer Position, Exabyting follows a 4-stage interview process. They often give job advertisements on LinkedIn. We have to apply using the Google form mentioned in the post. In the Google form, some questionnaires about yourself and some basic technical questions are given sometimes. I applied several times through the Google form but never got a call. Last time, I applied through a referral from an employee of theirs and got shortlisted. The interview process is as follows:Phone Interview: After applying and getting shortlisted, one of the employees will call you and ask you some basic questions about Computer Science.Round 1: The first round is a technical round and generally lasts for half an hour. An engineering manager will join in this stage and ask about you, your hobbies, currently what are you doing and some basic questions.Round 2: The second round is also a technical round. This interview session is taken by 3 software engineers and runs for around one and a half hours. In this round, they ask you about your projects, your role in the projects, and some technical questions. They will ask questions based on your recent used tech stack.CEO Round: This is a behavioural interview with the CEO of the company. In this meeting, he briefs you about the vision and mission of the company. What is the long-term goal of the company, what is their expectation from the company and what is your expectation from the company? He also briefs about the culture of the company. He tries to understand whether you are aligned with their company culture or not. He also asks if you have any preference for any department like backend, frontend mobile application etc.Phone Interview ​Difference between Array and Linked List.Show AnswerArray: An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. It has a fixed size and allows random access to elements using an index.Linked List: A linked list is a data structure that consists of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. It does not require contiguous memory allocation and allows dynamic memory allocation.Read more from Array vs Linked List | GeeksforGeeksWhich sorting algorithm works better in the average case?Show AnswerMerge sort and Quick sort work better in the average case. Merge sort has a time complexity of O(nlogn) in the worst case. Quick sort has a time complexity of O(nlogn) in the average case. Both are stable sorting algorithms and work well with large and medium datasets.Suppose, you have to sort 1000 numbers, numbers can be positive and negative. Which algorithm will you use?Show AnswerWe can use merge sort to sort the 1000 numbers. Merge sort has a time complexity of O(nlogn) in the worst case. It is a stable sorting algorithm and works well with large and medium datasets. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm.What is Stack, Queue and Priority Queue?Show AnswerStack: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. It has two main operations: push (insert) and pop (remove).Queue: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. It has two main operations: enqueue (insert) and dequeue (remove).Priority Queue: A priority queue is a data structure that stores elements based on their priority. It allows elements with higher priority to be dequeued before elements with lower priority.Difference between Binary Tree and BST.Show AnswerBinary Tree:A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.Binary Search Tree: A binary search tree is a binary tree in which the value of the left child is less than the parent node and the value of the right child is greater than the parent node.If the binary search tree is imbalanced, then we can make it balanced by using AVL tree or Red-Black tree. These trees are self-balancing binary search trees.When we type a web address (www.google.com) in a web browser, what happens before we get the response?Show AnswerThis is a very important question and aims to check the knowledge of networking. A very thorough explanation of this question is answered here in What Happens WhenDifference between TCP and UDP.Show AnswerTCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol. It is used to establish a connection between two devices before transferring data. It is reliable but slower than UDP.UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol. It does not establish a connection before transferring data. It is faster but less reliable than TCP.The main difference between TCP (transmission control protocol) and UDP (user datagram protocol) is that TCP is a connection-based protocol and UDP is connectionless. While TCP is more reliable, it transfers data more slowly. UDP is less reliable but works more quickly. This makes each protocol suited to different types of data transfers.Read more from TCP vs UDP: What's the Difference? | CloudflareWhat are the principles of OOP and why do we use OOP?Show AnswerThe four main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:Encapsulation – Bundling data and methods within a class while restricting direct access to some details.Abstraction – Hiding implementation details and exposing only essential functionalities.Inheritance – Enabling a class to derive properties and behavior from another class.Polymorphism – Allowing a single interface to represent different data types or methods (e.g., method overloading and overriding).OOP is used to model real-world entities and relationships in software development. It promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability by organizing code into classes and objects. OOP also supports concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, making it easier to manage complex systems.Difference between SQL and NoSQL.Show AnswerSQL: Full form of SQL is Structured Query Language . SQL databases are primarily called Relational Databases (RDBMS). They use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data. These are table-based databases. SQL databases are good for complex queries and relationships between the tables.NoSQL: NoSQL databases are primarily called non-relational or distributed databases. They can be document-based, key-value pairs, graph databases, or wide-column stores. They have dynamic schemas for unstructured data. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.Read more from Understanding SQL vs NoSQL Databases | MongoDBDifference between Compiler and Interpreter.Show AnswerCompiler: A compiler translates code from a high-level programming language into machine code before the program runs.Interpreter: An interpreter translates code written in a high-level programming language into machine code line-by-line as the code runs.To learn more about the difference between Compiler and Interpreter, read this article: Difference between Compiler and InterpreterFirst Round Questions ​Explain BST.Show AnswerBinary Search Tree: A binary search tree is a binary tree in which the value of the left child is less than the parent node and the value of the right child is greater than the parent node.Suppose, we insert [1, 2, 3, 4] this array in BST. What will it look like after insertion? What is the search complexity in this tree? What if we want to make the search complexity O(logn)?Show Answer The tree will look like this:     1\n     \\\n      2\n       \\\n        3\n         \\\n          4And the search complexity will be O(n) in this case. To make the search complexity O(logn), we have to make the tree balanced. We can use AVL tree or Red-Black tree to make the tree balanced.Left Join VS Full Join. Describe a scenario where we need to use Left Join.Show Answer Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table. The result is NULL from the right side if there is no matchRIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table. The result is NULL from the left side when there is no matchFULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.A scenario where we need to use Left Join is when we want to get all the records from the left table and the matched records from the right table. For example, we have two tables, one is the students table and another is the marks table. We want to get all the students' information and their marks. If a student has no marks, then we want to show NULL in the marks column. In this case, we will use Left Join. The SQL query will look like this:sqlSELECT students.name, marks.marks\nFROM students\nLEFT JOIN marks ON students.id = marks.student_id;Describe the ACID properties of the database.Show AnswerACID is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. Databases that support this are called ACID compliance. The properties areAtomicity: Each statement in a transaction (to read, write, update or delete data) is treated as a single unit. Either the entire statement is executed, or none of it is executed.Consistency: Ensures the databases remain consistent following some predefined business logic both before and after the transactionIsolation: Each transaction executes in such a way that one is not affected by other s though they were occurring only one.Durability: The data changes by a successfull transaction is saved even in the event of system failureIMPORTANTAtomicity, isolation and durability are properties of the database, whereas consistency is a property of the application. The C in ACID was tossed in to make the acronym work. [ref: Martin Kleppmann, Designing Data Intensive Applications]Describe the indexing of the database. Can we index with a column that has duplicate elements?Show AnswerIndexing is a data structure technique that is used to quickly locate and access the data in a database. it is created mainly using B+ trees.If a column has duplicate elements, then we can still create index on that column.Read more from What is Indexing in Database? | MediumDescribe the Event loop in JS.What is closure?

This means that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local.Read more from JavaScript Hoisting Explained | DigitalOceanExplain primitive and reference data types.Show AnswerPrimitive Data Types: Primitive values are data that are stored directly in a variable. These include numbers, booleans, strings, null, and undefined. When we assign a primitive value to a variable, a copy of that value is created and stored in memory. Any changes made to the variable do not affect the original value.Reference Data Types: Reference values, on the other hand, are objects that are stored in memory and accessed through a reference. These include arrays, objects, and functions. When we assign a reference value to a variable, a reference to the original value is created and stored in memory. Any changes made to the variable affect the original value.Read more from JavaScript Primitive Values vs Reference Values | FreeCodeCampExplain closure. The inner function (which is returned) of the closure has access to its outer scope, how is it possible, where the variable is stored in that time?What is a pure function?Show AnswerA pure function is a function where the return value is determined by its input values, without observable side effects. This is how a pure function works:The function always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed in.The function does not depend on any state, or data, change during its execution.The function does not modify any state, or data, outside of its scope.Read more from [Pure Functions in JavaScript | Medium]https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-pure-function-d1c076bec976)Do you follow any functional programming philosophy?Explain the ACID properties of the database.Show AnswerACID is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. Databases that support this are called ACID compliance. The properties areAtomicity: Each statement in a transaction (to read, write, update or delete data) is treated as a single unit. Either the entire statement is executed, or none of it is executed.Consistency: Ensures the databases remain consistent following some predefined business logic both before and after the transactionIsolation: Each transaction executes in such a way that one is not affected by other s though they were occurring only one.Durability: The data changes by a successfull transaction is saved even in the event of system failureIMPORTANTAtomicity, isolation and durability are properties of the database, whereas consistency is a property of the application. The C in ACID was tossed in to make the acronym work. [ref: Martin Kleppmann, Designing Data Intensive Applications]Explain indexing. Why do we need indexing? What benefit does it give us?Show AnswerIndexing is a data structure technique that is used to quickly locate and access the data in a database. it is created mainly using B+ trees.Indexing is important because it helps to speed up the retrieval of data from the database. It is used to quickly locate and access the data in a database. Without an index, the database engine has to scan the entire table to find the data. This can be very slow if the table is large. However, creating an unnecessary index can slow down the database system because the database engine has to update the index every time the table is updated.Read more from What is Indexing in Database? | MediumSuppose, we want to use user_email as index. How can we do it?Show AnswersqlCREATE INDEX user_email_index ON users (user_email);Explain tree, binary tree, binary search tree. In a binary search tree, if the tree is imbalanced, then how can we make it balanced?Show AnswerBinary Tree:A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.Binary Search Tree: A binary search tree is a binary tree in which the value of the left child is less than the parent node and the value of the right child is greater than the parent node.If the binary search tree is imbalanced, then we can make it balanced by using AVL tree or Red-Black tree. These trees are self-balancing binary search trees.Explain the map, unordered_map and their complexity. Why does the complexity of the unordered_map go to O(n) in some cases?Show AnswerMap: A map is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It is typically implemented as a balanced binary search tree, which gives it a time complexity of O(logn) for insertion, deletion, and search.Unordered Map: An unordered map is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It is typically implemented as a hash table, which gives it an average time complexity of O(1) for insertion, deletion, and search. However, in the worst case, the time complexity can go up to O(n) if there are many collisions.Read more from Map vs Unordered Map in C++ | GeeksforGeeksExplain the four principles of OOP.Show AnswerThe four main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:Encapsulation – Bundling data and methods within a class while restricting direct access to some details.Abstraction – Hiding implementation details and exposing only essential functionalities.Inheritance – Enabling a class to derive properties and behavior from another class.Polymorphism – Allowing a single interface to represent different data types or methods (e.g., method overloading and overriding).Do you know there is an OOP feature which is only in C/C++?Show AnswerOperator overloading is a feature in C++ that allows operators to be redefined so that they work with user-defined types. This feature is not available in all OOP languages like Java or Python.Explain the difference between an array and a linked list. Tell me some use cases for each of them. How can we access an element of an array with the index?Explain HTTP and HTTPS. Why HTTPS? How does data transfer in HTTPS? What is used under the hood to encrypt the communication between the sender and the receiver?Show AnswerHTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a communication protocol used for transferring data between web browsers and servers. It operates over port 80 and does not encrypt data, making it vulnerable to attacks like Man-in-the-Middle (MITM).HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, using encryption to protect data from interception and tampering. It operates over port 443 and ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.In HTTPS, data transfer is encrypted using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security). When a user connects to a secure website, the browser and server perform an SSL/TLS handshake, exchanging encryption keys and verifying the server’s identity using an SSL certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). The encryption uses asymmetric cryptography (RSA, ECC) for key exchange and symmetric encryption (AES) for actual data transfer, ensuring secure communication.Is HTTPS stateful or stateless? If stateless, then how can we browse Facebook after login once?Show AnswerHTTPS itself is stateless because it follows the HTTP protocol, which does not retain session information between requests. However, websites like Facebook manage user sessions using cookies and tokens to maintain state.When we log in, the server sends a session ID (stored in a cookie) to our browser. This session ID is sent with every request, allowing the server to recognize and authenticate us. Additionally, modern web applications use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth tokens for secure authentication and session management. This way, even though HTTPS is stateless, the session is maintained through these mechanisms.Explain cookie-based authentication. How can we blacklist a cookie?Show AnswerCookie-based authentication is a method where a server issues a session cookie upon successful login. This cookie, stored in the user's browser, is sent with every subsequent request, allowing the server to identify the user without requiring reauthentication. The server typically stores session details in a database or in-memory store (e.g., Redis). Cookies can have attributes like HttpOnly (prevents JavaScript access), Secure (only sent over HTTPS), and SameSite (prevents CSRF attacks).How to Blacklist a Cookie? ​Server-Side Invalidation – Remove the session from the database or cache, making the cookie useless.Set Expiry in the Past – Send a new Set-Cookie header with an expired timestamp.Revoke the Cookie via Logout – Overwrite it with an empty value.Use a Token Blacklist – If using JWT, maintain a blacklist of revoked tokens.Read more from Cookie-Based Authentication: A Comprehensive Guide | Auth0Do you know the structure of JWT? Explain.Show AnswerJWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The structure of a JWT consists of three parts separated by dots: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzzHeader: Contains metadata about the token (e.g., type and signing algorithm).Payload: Contains claims (e.g., user ID, role, and expiration time).Signature: Ensures the integrity of the token and verifies that it has not been tampered with.Read more from Introduction to JSON Web Tokens | JWT.ioProblem Statement: You'll be given two strings A and B, with lengths 1 <= length <= 10^6. The strings will contain only 1's and 0's. To make A a good string, you can insert B into A at any place, as many times as you want (or don't insert if you don't want). You have to print YES or NO depending on whether making A as a good string is possible.Show DetailsThe Definition of GOOD: A good string will never consecutively have two 1's or two 0's.Input/Output: The input will consist of two strings in two lines, strings A and B.The output must be only one word, \"YES\" or \"NO\".Sample Input/Output:InputOutput101010YES111010YES111001101010NO100100100010NOConvert a decimal number to binary and show the output in string.Show Answercpp#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nstring decimalToBinary(int n) {\n    string binary = \"\";\n    while (n > 0) {\n        binary += to_string(n % 2);\n        n /= 2;\n    }\n    reverse(binary.begin(), binary.end());\n    return binary;\n}Explain JOIN and composite keys in the database.Show AnswerJOIN: JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are different types of JOINs in SQL, such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.Composite Key: A composite key is a combination of two or more columns in a table that can be used to uniquely identify each row in the table. A composite key is also known as a compound key.Learn about polymorphism and inheritance in DB in your free time. (This is not a question).

They have been successfully providing software services since 2018 in both the local and global market.Interview Stages ​For the Trainee Software Engineer Position, Exabyting follows a 4-stage interview process. They often give job advertisements on LinkedIn. We have to apply using the Google form mentioned in the post. In the Google form, some questionnaires about yourself and some basic technical questions are given sometimes. I applied several times through the Google form but never got a call. Last time, I applied through a referral from an employee of theirs and got shortlisted. The interview process is as follows:Phone Interview: After applying and getting shortlisted, one of the employees will call you and ask you some basic questions about Computer Science.Round 1: The first round is a technical round and generally lasts for half an hour. An engineering manager will join in this stage and ask about you, your hobbies, currently what are you doing and some basic questions.Round 2: The second round is also a technical round. This interview session is taken by 3 software engineers and runs for around one and a half hours. In this round, they ask you about your projects, your role in the projects, and some technical questions. They will ask questions based on your recent used tech stack.CEO Round: This is a behavioural interview with the CEO of the company. In this meeting, he briefs you about the vision and mission of the company. What is the long-term goal of the company, what is their expectation from the company and what is your expectation from the company? He also briefs about the culture of the company. He tries to understand whether you are aligned with their company culture or not. He also asks if you have any preference for any department like backend, frontend mobile application etc.Phone Interview ​Difference between Array and Linked List.Show AnswerArray: An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. It has a fixed size and allows random access to elements using an index.Linked List: A linked list is a data structure that consists of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. It does not require contiguous memory allocation and allows dynamic memory allocation.Read more from Array vs Linked List | GeeksforGeeksWhich sorting algorithm works better in the average case?Show AnswerMerge sort and Quick sort work better in the average case. Merge sort has a time complexity of O(nlogn) in the worst case. Quick sort has a time complexity of O(nlogn) in the average case. Both are stable sorting algorithms and work well with large and medium datasets.Suppose, you have to sort 1000 numbers, numbers can be positive and negative. Which algorithm will you use?Show AnswerWe can use merge sort to sort the 1000 numbers. Merge sort has a time complexity of O(nlogn) in the worst case. It is a stable sorting algorithm and works well with large and medium datasets. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm.What is Stack, Queue and Priority Queue?Show AnswerStack: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. It has two main operations: push (insert) and pop (remove).Queue: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. It has two main operations: enqueue (insert) and dequeue (remove).Priority Queue: A priority queue is a data structure that stores elements based on their priority. It allows elements with higher priority to be dequeued before elements with lower priority.Difference between Binary Tree and BST.Show AnswerBinary Tree:A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.Binary Search Tree: A binary search tree is a binary tree in which the value of the left child is less than the parent node and the value of the right child is greater than the parent node.If the binary search tree is imbalanced, then we can make it balanced by using AVL tree or Red-Black tree. These trees are self-balancing binary search trees.When we type a web address (www.google.com) in a web browser, what happens before we get the response?Show AnswerThis is a very important question and aims to check the knowledge of networking. A very thorough explanation of this question is answered here in What Happens WhenDifference between TCP and UDP.Show AnswerTCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol. It is used to establish a connection between two devices before transferring data. It is reliable but slower than UDP.UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol. It does not establish a connection before transferring data. It is faster but less reliable than TCP.The main difference between TCP (transmission control protocol) and UDP (user datagram protocol) is that TCP is a connection-based protocol and UDP is connectionless. While TCP is more reliable, it transfers data more slowly. UDP is less reliable but works more quickly. This makes each protocol suited to different types of data transfers.Read more from TCP vs UDP: What's the Difference? | CloudflareWhat are the principles of OOP and why do we use OOP?Show AnswerThe four main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:Encapsulation – Bundling data and methods within a class while restricting direct access to some details.Abstraction – Hiding implementation details and exposing only essential functionalities.Inheritance – Enabling a class to derive properties and behavior from another class.Polymorphism – Allowing a single interface to represent different data types or methods (e.g., method overloading and overriding).OOP is used to model real-world entities and relationships in software development. It promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability by organizing code into classes and objects. OOP also supports concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, making it easier to manage complex systems.Difference between SQL and NoSQL.Show AnswerSQL: Full form of SQL is Structured Query Language . SQL databases are primarily called Relational Databases (RDBMS). They use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data. These are table-based databases. SQL databases are good for complex queries and relationships between the tables.NoSQL: NoSQL databases are primarily called non-relational or distributed databases. They can be document-based, key-value pairs, graph databases, or wide-column stores. They have dynamic schemas for unstructured data. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.Read more from Understanding SQL vs NoSQL Databases | MongoDBDifference between Compiler and Interpreter.Show AnswerCompiler: A compiler translates code from a high-level programming language into machine code before the program runs.Interpreter: An interpreter translates code written in a high-level programming language into machine code line-by-line as the code runs.To learn more about the difference between Compiler and Interpreter, read this article: Difference between Compiler and InterpreterFirst Round Questions ​Explain BST.Show AnswerBinary Search Tree: A binary search tree is a binary tree in which the value of the left child is less than the parent node and the value of the right child is greater than the parent node.Suppose, we insert [1, 2, 3, 4] this array in BST. What will it look like after insertion? What is the search complexity in this tree? What if we want to make the search complexity O(logn)?Show Answer The tree will look like this:     1\n     \\\n      2\n       \\\n        3\n         \\\n          4And the search complexity will be O(n) in this case. To make the search complexity O(logn), we have to make the tree balanced. We can use AVL tree or Red-Black tree to make the tree balanced.Left Join VS Full Join. Describe a scenario where we need to use Left Join.Show Answer Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table. The result is NULL from the right side if there is no matchRIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table. The result is NULL from the left side when there is no matchFULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.A scenario where we need to use Left Join is when we want to get all the records from the left table and the matched records from the right table. For example, we have two tables, one is the students table and another is the marks table. We want to get all the students' information and their marks. If a student has no marks, then we want to show NULL in the marks column. In this case, we will use Left Join. The SQL query will look like this:sqlSELECT students.name, marks.marks\nFROM students\nLEFT JOIN marks ON students.id = marks.student_id;Describe the ACID properties of the database.Show AnswerACID is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. Databases that support this are called ACID compliance. The properties areAtomicity: Each statement in a transaction (to read, write, update or delete data) is treated as a single unit. Either the entire statement is executed, or none of it is executed.Consistency: Ensures the databases remain consistent following some predefined business logic both before and after the transactionIsolation: Each transaction executes in such a way that one is not affected by other s though they were occurring only one.Durability: The data changes by a successfull transaction is saved even in the event of system failureIMPORTANTAtomicity, isolation and durability are properties of the database, whereas consistency is a property of the application. The C in ACID was tossed in to make the acronym work. [ref: Martin Kleppmann, Designing Data Intensive Applications]Describe the indexing of the database. Can we index with a column that has duplicate elements?Show AnswerIndexing is a data structure technique that is used to quickly locate and access the data in a database. it is created mainly using B+ trees.If a column has duplicate elements, then we can still create index on that column.Read more from What is Indexing in Database? | MediumDescribe the Event loop in JS.What is closure?

What is the long-term goal of the company, what is their expectation from the company and what is your expectation from the company? He also briefs about the culture of the company. He tries to understand whether you are aligned with their company culture or not. He also asks if you have any preference for any department like backend, frontend mobile application etc.Phone Interview ​Difference between Array and Linked List.Show AnswerArray: An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. It has a fixed size and allows random access to elements using an index.Linked List: A linked list is a data structure that consists of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. It does not require contiguous memory allocation and allows dynamic memory allocation.Read more from Array vs Linked List | GeeksforGeeksWhich sorting algorithm works better in the average case?Show AnswerMerge sort and Quick sort work better in the average case. Merge sort has a time complexity of O(nlogn) in the worst case. Quick sort has a time complexity of O(nlogn) in the average case. Both are stable sorting algorithms and work well with large and medium datasets.Suppose, you have to sort 1000 numbers, numbers can be positive and negative. Which algorithm will you use?Show AnswerWe can use merge sort to sort the 1000 numbers. Merge sort has a time complexity of O(nlogn) in the worst case. It is a stable sorting algorithm and works well with large and medium datasets. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm.What is Stack, Queue and Priority Queue?Show AnswerStack: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. It has two main operations: push (insert) and pop (remove).Queue: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. It has two main operations: enqueue (insert) and dequeue (remove).Priority Queue: A priority queue is a data structure that stores elements based on their priority. It allows elements with higher priority to be dequeued before elements with lower priority.Difference between Binary Tree and BST.Show AnswerBinary Tree:A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.Binary Search Tree: A binary search tree is a binary tree in which the value of the left child is less than the parent node and the value of the right child is greater than the parent node.If the binary search tree is imbalanced, then we can make it balanced by using AVL tree or Red-Black tree. These trees are self-balancing binary search trees.When we type a web address (www.google.com) in a web browser, what happens before we get the response?Show AnswerThis is a very important question and aims to check the knowledge of networking. A very thorough explanation of this question is answered here in What Happens WhenDifference between TCP and UDP.Show AnswerTCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol. It is used to establish a connection between two devices before transferring data. It is reliable but slower than UDP.UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol. It does not establish a connection before transferring data. It is faster but less reliable than TCP.The main difference between TCP (transmission control protocol) and UDP (user datagram protocol) is that TCP is a connection-based protocol and UDP is connectionless. While TCP is more reliable, it transfers data more slowly. UDP is less reliable but works more quickly. This makes each protocol suited to different types of data transfers.Read more from TCP vs UDP: What's the Difference? | CloudflareWhat are the principles of OOP and why do we use OOP?Show AnswerThe four main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:Encapsulation – Bundling data and methods within a class while restricting direct access to some details.Abstraction – Hiding implementation details and exposing only essential functionalities.Inheritance – Enabling a class to derive properties and behavior from another class.Polymorphism – Allowing a single interface to represent different data types or methods (e.g., method overloading and overriding).OOP is used to model real-world entities and relationships in software development. It promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability by organizing code into classes and objects. OOP also supports concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, making it easier to manage complex systems.Difference between SQL and NoSQL.Show AnswerSQL: Full form of SQL is Structured Query Language . SQL databases are primarily called Relational Databases (RDBMS). They use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data. These are table-based databases. SQL databases are good for complex queries and relationships between the tables.NoSQL: NoSQL databases are primarily called non-relational or distributed databases. They can be document-based, key-value pairs, graph databases, or wide-column stores. They have dynamic schemas for unstructured data. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.Read more from Understanding SQL vs NoSQL Databases | MongoDBDifference between Compiler and Interpreter.Show AnswerCompiler: A compiler translates code from a high-level programming language into machine code before the program runs.Interpreter: An interpreter translates code written in a high-level programming language into machine code line-by-line as the code runs.To learn more about the difference between Compiler and Interpreter, read this article: Difference between Compiler and InterpreterFirst Round Questions ​Explain BST.Show AnswerBinary Search Tree: A binary search tree is a binary tree in which the value of the left child is less than the parent node and the value of the right child is greater than the parent node.Suppose, we insert [1, 2, 3, 4] this array in BST. What will it look like after insertion? What is the search complexity in this tree? What if we want to make the search complexity O(logn)?Show Answer The tree will look like this:     1\n     \\\n      2\n       \\\n        3\n         \\\n          4And the search complexity will be O(n) in this case. To make the search complexity O(logn), we have to make the tree balanced. We can use AVL tree or Red-Black tree to make the tree balanced.Left Join VS Full Join. Describe a scenario where we need to use Left Join.Show Answer Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table. The result is NULL from the right side if there is no matchRIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table. The result is NULL from the left side when there is no matchFULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.A scenario where we need to use Left Join is when we want to get all the records from the left table and the matched records from the right table. For example, we have two tables, one is the students table and another is the marks table. We want to get all the students' information and their marks. If a student has no marks, then we want to show NULL in the marks column. In this case, we will use Left Join. The SQL query will look like this:sqlSELECT students.name, marks.marks\nFROM students\nLEFT JOIN marks ON students.id = marks.student_id;Describe the ACID properties of the database.Show AnswerACID is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. Databases that support this are called ACID compliance. The properties areAtomicity: Each statement in a transaction (to read, write, update or delete data) is treated as a single unit. Either the entire statement is executed, or none of it is executed.Consistency: Ensures the databases remain consistent following some predefined business logic both before and after the transactionIsolation: Each transaction executes in such a way that one is not affected by other s though they were occurring only one.Durability: The data changes by a successfull transaction is saved even in the event of system failureIMPORTANTAtomicity, isolation and durability are properties of the database, whereas consistency is a property of the application. The C in ACID was tossed in to make the acronym work. [ref: Martin Kleppmann, Designing Data Intensive Applications]Describe the indexing of the database. Can we index with a column that has duplicate elements?Show AnswerIndexing is a data structure technique that is used to quickly locate and access the data in a database. it is created mainly using B+ trees.If a column has duplicate elements, then we can still create index on that column.Read more from What is Indexing in Database? | MediumDescribe the Event loop in JS.What is closure?

This means that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local.Read more from JavaScript Hoisting Explained | DigitalOceanExplain primitive and reference data types.Show AnswerPrimitive Data Types: Primitive values are data that are stored directly in a variable. These include numbers, booleans, strings, null, and undefined. When we assign a primitive value to a variable, a copy of that value is created and stored in memory. Any changes made to the variable do not affect the original value.Reference Data Types: Reference values, on the other hand, are objects that are stored in memory and accessed through a reference. These include arrays, objects, and functions. When we assign a reference value to a variable, a reference to the original value is created and stored in memory. Any changes made to the variable affect the original value.Read more from JavaScript Primitive Values vs Reference Values | FreeCodeCampExplain closure. The inner function (which is returned) of the closure has access to its outer scope, how is it possible, where the variable is stored in that time?What is a pure function?Show AnswerA pure function is a function where the return value is determined by its input values, without observable side effects. This is how a pure function works:The function always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed in.The function does not depend on any state, or data, change during its execution.The function does not modify any state, or data, outside of its scope.Read more from [Pure Functions in JavaScript | Medium]https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-pure-function-d1c076bec976)Do you follow any functional programming philosophy?Explain the ACID properties of the database.Show AnswerACID is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps.

What benefit does it give us?Show AnswerIndexing is a data structure technique that is used to quickly locate and access the data in a database. it is created mainly using B+ trees.Indexing is important because it helps to speed up the retrieval of data from the database. It is used to quickly locate and access the data in a database. Without an index, the database engine has to scan the entire table to find the data. This can be very slow if the table is large. However, creating an unnecessary index can slow down the database system because the database engine has to update the index every time the table is updated.Read more from What is Indexing in Database? | MediumSuppose, we want to use user_email as index. How can we do it?Show AnswersqlCREATE INDEX user_email_index ON users (user_email);Explain tree, binary tree, binary search tree. In a binary search tree, if the tree is imbalanced, then how can we make it balanced?Show AnswerBinary Tree:A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.Binary Search Tree: A binary search tree is a binary tree in which the value of the left child is less than the parent node and the value of the right child is greater than the parent node.If the binary search tree is imbalanced, then we can make it balanced by using AVL tree or Red-Black tree. These trees are self-balancing binary search trees.Explain the map, unordered_map and their complexity. Why does the complexity of the unordered_map go to O(n) in some cases?Show AnswerMap: A map is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It is typically implemented as a balanced binary search tree, which gives it a time complexity of O(logn) for insertion, deletion, and search.Unordered Map: An unordered map is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It is typically implemented as a hash table, which gives it an average time complexity of O(1) for insertion, deletion, and search. However, in the worst case, the time complexity can go up to O(n) if there are many collisions.Read more from Map vs Unordered Map in C++ | GeeksforGeeksExplain the four principles of OOP.Show AnswerThe four main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:Encapsulation – Bundling data and methods within a class while restricting direct access to some details.Abstraction – Hiding implementation details and exposing only essential functionalities.Inheritance – Enabling a class to derive properties and behavior from another class.Polymorphism – Allowing a single interface to represent different data types or methods (e.g., method overloading and overriding).Do you know there is an OOP feature which is only in C/C++?Show AnswerOperator overloading is a feature in C++ that allows operators to be redefined so that they work with user-defined types. This feature is not available in all OOP languages like Java or Python.Explain the difference between an array and a linked list. Tell me some use cases for each of them. How can we access an element of an array with the index?Explain HTTP and HTTPS. Why HTTPS? How does data transfer in HTTPS? What is used under the hood to encrypt the communication between the sender and the receiver?Show AnswerHTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a communication protocol used for transferring data between web browsers and servers. It operates over port 80 and does not encrypt data, making it vulnerable to attacks like Man-in-the-Middle (MITM).HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, using encryption to protect data from interception and tampering. It operates over port 443 and ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.In HTTPS, data transfer is encrypted using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security). When a user connects to a secure website, the browser and server perform an SSL/TLS handshake, exchanging encryption keys and verifying the server’s identity using an SSL certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). The encryption uses asymmetric cryptography (RSA, ECC) for key exchange and symmetric encryption (AES) for actual data transfer, ensuring secure communication.Is HTTPS stateful or stateless? If stateless, then how can we browse Facebook after login once?Show AnswerHTTPS itself is stateless because it follows the HTTP protocol, which does not retain session information between requests. However, websites like Facebook manage user sessions using cookies and tokens to maintain state.When we log in, the server sends a session ID (stored in a cookie) to our browser. This session ID is sent with every request, allowing the server to recognize and authenticate us. Additionally, modern web applications use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth tokens for secure authentication and session management. This way, even though HTTPS is stateless, the session is maintained through these mechanisms.Explain cookie-based authentication. How can we blacklist a cookie?Show AnswerCookie-based authentication is a method where a server issues a session cookie upon successful login. This cookie, stored in the user's browser, is sent with every subsequent request, allowing the server to identify the user without requiring reauthentication. The server typically stores session details in a database or in-memory store (e.g., Redis). Cookies can have attributes like HttpOnly (prevents JavaScript access), Secure (only sent over HTTPS), and SameSite (prevents CSRF attacks).How to Blacklist a Cookie? ​Server-Side Invalidation – Remove the session from the database or cache, making the cookie useless.Set Expiry in the Past – Send a new Set-Cookie header with an expired timestamp.Revoke the Cookie via Logout – Overwrite it with an empty value.Use a Token Blacklist – If using JWT, maintain a blacklist of revoked tokens.Read more from Cookie-Based Authentication: A Comprehensive Guide | Auth0Do you know the structure of JWT? Explain.Show AnswerJWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The structure of a JWT consists of three parts separated by dots: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzzHeader: Contains metadata about the token (e.g., type and signing algorithm).Payload: Contains claims (e.g., user ID, role, and expiration time).Signature: Ensures the integrity of the token and verifies that it has not been tampered with.Read more from Introduction to JSON Web Tokens | JWT.ioProblem Statement: You'll be given two strings A and B, with lengths 1 <= length <= 10^6. The strings will contain only 1's and 0's. To make A a good string, you can insert B into A at any place, as many times as you want (or don't insert if you don't want). You have to print YES or NO depending on whether making A as a good string is possible.Show DetailsThe Definition of GOOD: A good string will never consecutively have two 1's or two 0's.Input/Output: The input will consist of two strings in two lines, strings A and B.The output must be only one word, \"YES\" or \"NO\".Sample Input/Output:InputOutput101010YES111010YES111001101010NO100100100010NOConvert a decimal number to binary and show the output in string.Show Answercpp#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nstring decimalToBinary(int n) {\n    string binary = \"\";\n    while (n > 0) {\n        binary += to_string(n % 2);\n        n /= 2;\n    }\n    reverse(binary.begin(), binary.end());\n    return binary;\n}Explain JOIN and composite keys in the database.Show AnswerJOIN: JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are different types of JOINs in SQL, such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.Composite Key: A composite key is a combination of two or more columns in a table that can be used to uniquely identify each row in the table.

Find the number of subarrays where the maximum element is between x and yTechnical Round Questions ​Suppose you want to update value of a field in a database. Generally, a read operation is done to fetch the value. Based on the retrieved value some logic is applies and the result is updated in the field. Example, subtract from balance if the balance is more than some threshold. Another client in the meantime can update the field too thus resulting unexpected behaviour. How can this be solved?Show AnswerThere can be multiple approach to solve this problem.Complete the whole scenario in one query.Use stored procedureUse locks. Add an extra column for the purpose of locking. Before fetching a data for update, set the said lock to 1. If it is already 1 then don't proceed.How authentication is done in microservice based applications?",

The questions aren't directly asked; instead, they are discussed in the context of a coding problem or a concept. (I am sharing real experience of mine):Interviewer: Here's a scenario: you need to create a class for database connections, and as every developer of your team needs to use the same database connection, you should only allow one instance of this class. How would you implement this in Java?Candidate: I would include a static variable within the class, initially set to null. I'd also create a static method called \"connection.\" This method would first check if the static variable is null. If it is, it would create a new object, assign it to the variable, and then return it. If the variable is not null, it would simply return the existing object.Interviewer: But if someone creates an object of this class, wouldn't they get a different object?Candidate: To prevent that, I would make the constructor private.Interviewer: Is this approach feasible? Would you need to do anything else?Candidate: Yes, it's feasible, and no further changes are necessary.Interviewer: The process you described has a specific name in design patterns. Do you recall what it's called?Candidate: Sorry, I don't know the name.Interviewer: It's called the Singleton pattern.Show AnswerSolution: Below is the implementation of the Singleton pattern in Java:Single ThreadedThread Safejava// Singleton class to manage database connections\npublic class DatabaseConnection {\n    // Static variable to hold the single instance of the class\n    private static DatabaseConnection instance = null;\n\n    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation\n    private DatabaseConnection() {\n        // Initialization code, e.g., establish database connection\n    }\n\n    // Public method to provide access to the single instance\n    public static DatabaseConnection getInstance() {\n        // Check if instance is null, create new one if needed\n        if (instance == null) {\n            instance = new DatabaseConnection();\n        }\n        // Return the existing instance\n        return instance;\n    }\n}govar lock = &sync.Mutex{}\n\ntype single struct {\n}\n\nvar singleInstance *single\n\nfunc getInstance() *single {\n    if singleInstance == nil {\n        lock.Lock()\n        defer lock.Unlock()\n        if singleInstance == nil {\n            fmt.Println(\"Creating single instance now.\")\n            singleInstance = &single{}\n        } else {\n            fmt.Println(\"Single instance already created.\")\n        }\n    } else {\n        fmt.Println(\"Single instance already created.\")\n    }\n\n    return singleInstance\n}WARNINGThe given single threaded implementation of the singleton pattern though widely popular, is not thread-safe. If a multithreaded application were to get the connection, there is a chance that the connection is initialized multiple times. Ask the interviewer to make sure if they want it to be thread-safe.

The questions aren't directly asked; instead, they are discussed in the context of a coding problem or a concept. (I am sharing real experience of mine):Interviewer: Here's a scenario: you need to create a class for database connections, and as every developer of your team needs to use the same database connection, you should only allow one instance of this class. How would you implement this in Java?Candidate: I would include a static variable within the class, initially set to null. I'd also create a static method called \"connection.\" This method would first check if the static variable is null. If it is, it would create a new object, assign it to the variable, and then return it. If the variable is not null, it would simply return the existing object.Interviewer: But if someone creates an object of this class, wouldn't they get a different object?Candidate: To prevent that, I would make the constructor private.Interviewer: Is this approach feasible? Would you need to do anything else?Candidate: Yes, it's feasible, and no further changes are necessary.Interviewer: The process you described has a specific name in design patterns. Do you recall what it's called?Candidate: Sorry, I don't know the name.Interviewer: It's called the Singleton pattern.Show AnswerSolution: Below is the implementation of the Singleton pattern in Java:Single ThreadedThread Safejava// Singleton class to manage database connections\npublic class DatabaseConnection {\n    // Static variable to hold the single instance of the class\n    private static DatabaseConnection instance = null;\n\n    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation\n    private DatabaseConnection() {\n        // Initialization code, e.g., establish database connection\n    }\n\n    // Public method to provide access to the single instance\n    public static DatabaseConnection getInstance() {\n        // Check if instance is null, create new one if needed\n        if (instance == null) {\n            instance = new DatabaseConnection();\n        }\n        // Return the existing instance\n        return instance;\n    }\n}govar lock = &sync.Mutex{}\n\ntype single struct {\n}\n\nvar singleInstance *single\n\nfunc getInstance() *single {\n    if singleInstance == nil {\n        lock.Lock()\n        defer lock.Unlock()\n        if singleInstance == nil {\n            fmt.Println(\"Creating single instance now.\")\n            singleInstance = &single{}\n        } else {\n            fmt.Println(\"Single instance already created.\")\n        }\n    } else {\n        fmt.Println(\"Single instance already created.\")\n    }\n\n    return singleInstance\n}WARNINGThe given single threaded implementation of the singleton pattern though widely popular, is not thread-safe. If a multithreaded application were to get the connection, there is a chance that the connection is initialized multiple times. Ask the interviewer to make sure if they want it to be thread-safe.

It's more of a practical problem-solving task that evaluates your coding skills and problem-solving abilities. You will need to come up with the solution, write a clean code, testcases(edge cases are important), and submit it in a google form. It will be judged based on correctness, efficiency, and code quality.On-Site Interview: If you successfully complete the take-home assignment, you will be invited for an on-site interview. This will be a system design interview where you will be asked to design and code a system in 1 hour. Then you will be asked about your code, database design, sql queries, basic networking and OS, OOP concepts, design patterns and project related knowledge. There may be some in depth questions about the technologies in the projects that you have worked on. The whole interview may take around 2.5 hours. If you pass this stage, there may be a final interview with the hiring manager or a behavioral interview.Take-Home Assignment Questions ​Build a tshirt distribution systemShow DescriptionImagine you're working at a T-shirt factory and you manage orders by packing a bulk amount of shirts into a certain number of bags. For every order, you have a specification of how many bags you have to fill and a fixed number of shirts to fill them with. The requirement is to distribute the shirts in the bags as evenly as possible.For example, if there are 100 shirts and 10 bags, then each bag will get 10 shirts. However, sometimes the shirt factory will have production errors, and it might produce the wrong number of shirts. It's not going to be 200 shirts instead of 100, but there will be some minor deviation from the original number.Write a function to solve this problem. Define the function name, input parameters, and output type as you wish. The goal is to minimize the deviation of the number of shirts in each bag, i.e., distribute as evenly as possible, with the important aspect that only a single bag can have a different number of shirts. For example, if you have 10 bags and 103 shirts, then 9 bags can have 10 shirts, and the last bag can have 13 shirts. Here the deviation is 13 - 10 = 3, which is the minimum deviation.Task Management Software Reviewer AssignmentShow DescriptionLet's say you are building a task management software (get familiar with JIRA, Trello, or Asana). Each task in the system has a few properties:taskId: An integer identifier.assigneeName: The person who is assigned to or responsible for the task.reviewerName: The person responsible for reviewing the task (think code review) - this can be null.status: The current state of the task, which could be \"todo\", \"in-progress\", \"in-review\", or \"done\".estimateInHours: The number of hours estimated to complete this task for the assignee.Assume that you are given the list of tasks for a single team. We want to build a function that would do a simple recommendation for reviewers for each task. Given the list of tasks with the basic properties, our function should return a modified list where each task has a non-null reviewerName property, given that the task does not already have an assigned reviewer. The function should ensure that the reviewers are distributed as evenly as possible across all tasks and that the total effort for each team member is minimized.Constraints / Assumptions:Some tasks in the list will already have a reviewer assigned to them.You can assume all the tasks have one person assigned.You can assume that everyone on the team has at least one task assigned to them.You should only suggest reviewers for tasks that are in the \"in-review\" status.You should try to distribute reviewers as evenly as possible across all the tasks, so that one person does not review too many tasks.You should try to minimize the total effort in terms of the number of hours for each team member. Assume that reviewing a task takes 1/3 of the estimateInHours for that task.On-Site Interview Questions ​Design a Backend for a Simplified Version of Internet BankingShow DescriptionAcceptance Criteria: ​View Account Balance: Users can view their current account balance.Transfer Money: Users can transfer money to another registered user by providing the recipient's phone number and amount.Pay Utility Bill: Users can pay their utility bill to utility providers. They can choose the provider from a list of providers in the system.Top N Users by Transactions: Given a list of transactions, write a function that would return the top N users based on the number of transactions, in descending order of transaction volume. The result should include the user name, phone number, and number of transactions.View Transaction History: Users can view their transaction history, ordered by most recent. The history should include all kinds of transactions. For user transactions, it should include the recipient’s phone number and the amount. For bill payments, it should include the utility provider name. All transactions should also have the payment date.Bonus ProblemPromo Codes Management: Admin users can create promo codes in the system, which users can use while paying bills. Each promo code can be used a certain number of times per user, and each promo code has a certain amount of cashback.Promo Codes Analytics: Admin users can see a list of all promo codes, including the total number of uses, the average number of times utilized per user, and the total amount of cashback disbursed for each promo code. This list should be ordered by the most recent promo code first.",

They have different departments such as Research & Development (R&D), E-Gov, Reve Chat, etc.In this article, the recruitment process for the R&D department for the DEV roles (Junior Software Engineer) is presented. They perform campus recruitment.Interview Stages ​Online Screening Test: This round is conducted via Zoom. All the participants are required to keep their microphones and cameras on during the MCQ exam via Google form. Questions were given from the following areas:Basic problem solvingData structure and algorithmsTime ComplexityFinding error in code snippetsFinding the output of code blocksObject-oriented programmingSQLComputer networkingSoftware engineering and design patternsTechnical Round I: Two interviewers conducted this round via Skype. During the whole interview, the camera and microphone have to be on. At the beginning of the interview, a Google Doc might be shared for writing the code or any answers. Candidates are not allowed to use a pen or paper. Only the shared doc has to be used.Technical Round II: This round is also conducted via Skype, and two interviewers (project managers) might be there. This is a bit more technical than round 1. Topics may include - Java socket programming, computer networking, focusing on TCP and UDP protocols, software engineering and design patterns, SOLID principles, string matching algorithms (Naive, KMP).CTO Round: This will be an onsite round where the CTO and any other senior engineer. Candidates might be asked to solve problems using pen and paper.Technical Round I Questions ​Reverse a given singly linked list.💻 Submit CodeAt first, I used extra memory to store the reversed array.Show Answercppclass Solution {\npublic:\n    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {\n        if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL)\n            return head;\n        \n        int i;\n        vector<int> v;\n        ListNode* cur = head;\n        while (cur != NULL) {\n            v.push_back(cur->val);\n            cur = cur->next;\n        }\n        \n        i = v.size()-1;\n        cur = head;\n        while (head != NULL) {\n            head->val = v[i];\n            i--;\n            head = head->next;\n        }\n        return cur;\n    }\n};They told me not to use extra memory. So, I performed an in-place reversal of the linked list.Show Answercppclass Solution {\npublic:\n    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {\n        if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL)\n            return head;\n        \n        ListNode* prev = NULL;\n        while (head != NULL) {\n            ListNode* tmp = head->next;\n            head->next = prev;\n            prev = head;\n            head = tmp;\n        }\n        return prev;\n    }\n};Given a sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21..., where the indices start at 1. For any given index, find the value of the sequence. For example, when the input is 3, the output is 2, and when the input is 6, the output is 8.💻 Submit CodeAt first, I used an array for storing the calculated results of the intermediate steps and built the array going forward.Show Answercppint fib(int n){\n  \tint arr[n + 1];\n  \tarr[1] = 1;\n  \tarr[2] = 1;\n  \n  \tint i;\n  \tfor (i = 3; i <= n; i++) {\n          arr[i] = arr[i-1] + arr[i-2];\n  \t}\n  \treturn arr[n];\n }As I used an array to store the intermediate results, extra memory usage was involved. They told me not to use an array.

When implementing the recursion-based one, I first implemented the unoptimized version and later used an array for storing the intermediate values. After that, they asked me about the time and space complexities of the different approaches.Show Answercpp int fib(int n){\n\tif (n == 1)\n            return 1;\n\telse if (n == 2)\n            return 1;\n\telse\n\t    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);\n }Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.💻 Submit CodeShow Answercppclass Solution {\npublic:\n    bool isLeaf(TreeNode* root) {\n        return root->left == nullptr and root->right == nullptr;\n    }\n    bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum, int currentSum = 0) {\n        if(root == nullptr) return false;\n        currentSum+=root->val;\n        if(isLeaf(root)) return targetSum == currentSum;\n        return hasPathSum(root->left,targetSum, currentSum) or\n                hasPathSum(root->right,targetSum, currentSum);\n    }\n};Why are getters and setters used in Java?Describe the Singleton design pattern and write the code in Java.What are REST APIs?

If no cycle is present, print 0.Show AnswerC++#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nint firstNodeOfTheCycle, lastNodeOfTheCycle;\nbool detectCycle(int node, vector<vector<int>>& adjList, vector<bool> &visited, vector<bool> &dfsVisited, vector<int> &parent){\n    visited[node] = true;\n    dfsVisited[node] = true;\n\n    for(auto neighbour : adjList[node]){\n        if(!visited[neighbour]){\n            parent[neighbour] = node;\n            bool isCycleDetected = detectCycle(node, adjList, visited, dfsVisited, parent);\n            if(isCycleDetected){\n                firstNodeOfTheCycle = neighbour, lastNodeOfTheCycle = node;\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    dfsVisited[node] = false;\n    return false;\n}\n\nvoid calculateCycle(vector<int>& ans, vector<int>& parent){\n    int curNode = lastNodeOfTheCycle;\n    while(curNode != firstNodeOfTheCycle){\n        ans.push_back(curNode);\n        curNode = parent[curNode];\n    }\n    ans.push_back(curNode);\n}\nint main(){\n    int tc = 10;\n    for(int t = 1; t < tc; t++){\n        int n,m;\n        bool wasVisited = false;\n        cin >> n >> m;\n        vector<vector<int>>& adjList(n + 1);\n        vector<bool> visited(n + 1, false), dfsVisited(n + 1, false);\n        vector<int> parent(n + 1, -1), ans;\n        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++){\n            int u, v;\n            cin >> u >> v;\n            adjList[u].push_back(v);\n        }\n        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){\n            if(!visited[i]){\n                bool isCycleDetected = detectCycle(i, adjList, visited, dfsVisited, parent);\n                if(isCycleDetected){\n                    wasVisited = true;\n                    calculateCycle(ans, parent);\n                    sort(ans.begin(), ans.end());\n                    cout<<\"#\"<<t;\n                    for(auto it: ans){\n                        cout<<\" \"<<it;\n                    }\n                    cout<<endl;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        if(!wasVisited){\n            cout<<\"#\"<<t<<\" \"<<endl;\n        }\n    }\n}You have string with repeated character. Example : abcaade. Count the number of characters that occur more than once. You can’t use array or map.Show Answer[Answer 1] My approach : Sort & search concurrent character nlog(n).[Answer 2] Optimize approach : An integer have 32 bit. We have 26 small letter character. We just need to allocate each bit for position of a character. If an element is present set the concurrent bit and finally count the number of set bit. (Comment from Tamim: Before trying this approach communicate with the interviewer to make sure about the characters present in the string ie only a-z is present and nothing else)Technical Round Questions ​In pen and paper write the inner workings of a BST. How does a BST work? How to insert and retrieve a value from a BST?Thread A and Thread B are running parallely. What will be the output of following code?Show AnswerUnpredictable. It is not guaranteed that which thread is currently accessing the cnt variable. Was asked a follow up question on how to solve this issue? Given 5 element. We want to search million time that will return if the searched element is present or no. What is the best time complexity.Show AnswerYou might be tempted to answer using binary search on sorted list but it might be better to use linear search. The internal mechanism for binary search has some constant overhead. For small number that overhead overshadows the benefit of logarithmic complexity. I ran both linear search and binary search. Linear search is about 5 times faster than binary searchFollow up question. We are guaranteed that each time new search element would be front the next position of previous search. Write code on pen & paper.Show AnswerC++int lastElementPosition = 0;\nint solve( vector<int> arr, int element){\n\tint l =  0 , r = lastElementPosition;\n\twhile( l <= r){\n\t\tint mid = l + (r - l) / 2;\n        if( arr[mid] == element ){\n            lastElementPosition = mid;\n            return mid;\n        }\n        else if( element < arr[mid] ){\n            r = mid - 1;\n        }else{\n            lastElementPosition = l;\n            l = mid + 1;\n        }\n    }\n}Follow up question.

It has offices in Bangladesh (Dhaka), South Africa, Canada etc.Interview Stages ​Initial Screening: After dropping CV they take a MCQ Round, almost every candidate gets an email for participation in this round.Round 1: The first round is a technical round and generally lasts for an hour.Round 2: The second round is divided into two part. The first part is a behavioural part taken by HR of the company. For the second part two software engineer conducts the technical sessions.COO Round: The final round is taken by the COO of the companyMCQ Round ​A Broad Range of TopicsThis round consisted of a multiple-choice questionnaire covering these topics. The test required me to share my screen with Quillgo and keep my camera on. It covers wide range of topics like JavaScript fundamentals, OOP, DBMS, SWE principles, Networking, Rest API knowledge, Analytical reasoning, DSA (time complexity, sorting, binary trees, MST, greedy algorithms).First Round Questions ​Hands-On Problem SolvingWhat will the output of this code in C Programming Language and why?Cint arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};\n\nif(&arr[0] == &arr){\n    printf(\"They are the same!\");\n}else {\n    printf(\"Not same\");\n}Show AnswerThe name of the array is a pointer to the first item of the Array. So it will print \"They are the same!\"Given an array, what will be the base address if we print the array name only (e.g., printf(ara))?Show AnswerIt will print the address of the first item of the array. In C, you can't pass array to functions by \"Pass by value\". So when you pass an array to an function (for example: printf(arr)), the compiler will actually pass the pointer to the first element. You can easily test this hypothesis by doing something like this:Cint arr[1] = {100};\n\nif(arr == &arr){\n    printf(\"Yay!\\n\");\n}\n\nif(arr == &arr[0]){\n    printf(\"Damn!\");\n}The above code should printbashYay!\nDamn!What is the time complexity of the print statement? if it's O(1) why is that?

(Hint: Normalization)Given a Java code, identify issues that violate access modifiers.Explain the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).What are the ACID properties in DBMS?Show AnswerACID is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. Databases that support this are called ACID compliance. The properties areAtomicity: Each statement in a transaction (to read, write, update or delete data) is treated as a single unit. Either the entire statement is executed, or none of it is executed.Consistency: Ensures the databases remain consistent following some predefined business logic both before and after the transactionIsolation: Each transaction executes in such a way that one is not affected by other s though they were occurring only one.Durability: The data changes by a successfull transaction is saved even in the event of system failureIMPORTANTAtomicity, isolation and durability are properties of the database, whereas consistency is a property of the application.

So it will print \"They are the same!\"Given an array, what will be the base address if we print the array name only (e.g., printf(ara))?Show AnswerIt will print the address of the first item of the array. In C, you can't pass array to functions by \"Pass by value\". So when you pass an array to an function (for example: printf(arr)), the compiler will actually pass the pointer to the first element. You can easily test this hypothesis by doing something like this:Cint arr[1] = {100};\n\nif(arr == &arr){\n    printf(\"Yay!\\n\");\n}\n\nif(arr == &arr[0]){\n    printf(\"Damn!\");\n}The above code should printbashYay!\nDamn!What is the time complexity of the print statement? if it's O(1) why is that?

      "question": "On this pageHow to Apply to a Company ​Job hunting can often feel overwhelming, especially if you're just starting out or trying to make a significant career move. Over the years, I’ve learned a lot about what works—and what doesn’t—when applying for jobs, both as an applicant and a recruiter.In this post, I’ll share a step-by-step guide to help you navigate the process, from building a standout resume to preparing for interviews and handling job offers. Whether you’re a fresh graduate or someone looking to refine their approach, these tips are designed to make your journey smoother and more successful.It’s a detailed post, but I promise it’s worth your time. Let’s dive in!Step 0: Introductory Tasks ​Create a GitHub account if you don’t already have one (hopefully, everyone here does).Add a profile README like Tahmeed Vaiya’s GitHub.Upload your important projects to GitHub if you haven’t yet.Write a README for each repository. Most recruiters won’t run your code, so it’s better to include some kind of demo for your projects. This could be: Live websites, YouTube videos, Figma mockups, ScreenshotsBuild a simple personal website if you have time.Include details such as your achievements, education, experience, and other key information. The purpose of this website is to serve as an extension of your resume. Recruiters interested in knowing more about you might check out your website or GitHub.Create a LinkedIn account if you haven’t already.Try to keep it updated for at least the first 1–2 years of your professional life—you’ll thank me later!Step 1: Finding a company ​If the company visits BUET for a recruitment, then this is done.Otherwise, look for companies with open roles on LinkedIn. Almost all companies have a career page in their website. Go visit them time to time.Networking is the key. It is better to keep communication with your seniors to know when they have open roles. Many companies fill their vacancy through internal referral.Step 2: Finding the right role ​Identify the role that best matches your skills and interests. Carefully review the job description and assess their requirements. If you meet most of the requirements, you’re good to go.If you’re short on the minimum years of experience by 1–2 years, don’t worry—your time at BUET counts as relevant experience. It’s okay to miss a few of the preferred requirements as long as you meet the critical ones.Step 3: Background check ​Try to connect with someone from the company, ideally someone working in the role you’re applying for. Learn as much as you can about:The roleThe company cultureThe team you’ll potentially be working with.Remember, knowing is half the battle—this will help you confirm if the role is truly the right fit for you.Step 4: Resume preparation ​If I recall correctly, I’ve shared tips on resume building before. Regardless, here’s a comprehensive guide:Use a Template ​Avoid creating a resume from scratch; instead, use a tested template to save time and ensure quality. You can find excellent LaTeX templates like this one: GitHub: arasgungore-CV. For writing tips, refer to Indeed’s Guide on Technical Resumes.Keep It Concise ​Your resume shouldn’t be too long or too short—ideally, stick to one page. Avoid adding unnecessary details, like images.Key Sections to Include ​A good resume typically includes:Personal Information (Name, contact info, GitHub/LinkedIn links)ExperienceAchievementsProjectsSkillsEducationThesis (optional)Short Introduction (optional) Customize the order and skip sections if they aren’t relevant.Write Quantifiable Job Experience ​Highlight what you accomplished and its impact. Use a structure like: “Achieved X by doing Y, which resulted in Z% improvement.”Tailor your experience to align with the job requirements for each application. Example: Modify unrelated experiences to better match the role's responsibilities.Avoid adding irrelevant experiences unless you can frame them appropriately. For example: An experience in coaching can be presented positively if it demonstrates leadership or problem-solving skills.Showcase Projects Effectively ​Include at least three projects if you have no job experience. If you do have experience, include two significant projects to make room for your work history.Focus on:Problems solved or functionalities provided by the project.Tech stacks used, written concisely next to the project name (e.g., Project Name [React, Spring Boot]).Link to GitHub repositories and ensure your projects have well-written READMEs.Highlight Achievements ​When listing achievements, add context: If you ranked 5th, specify: “Ranked 5th out of 200 teams.”Percentiles are also impressive, e.g., “Ranked in the top 2% globally.”Review and Validate Your Resume ​Ask seniors or professionals (ideally someone from the company you’re applying to) to validate your resume. Remember, a great resume takes time to refine—it’s a process that evolves over a year or more.Additional Tips ​Avoid generic statements like:“I use React for frontend and Spring Boot with Hibernate for backend.” Instead, concisely include the stack next to your project title.Recruiters often spend less than a minute reviewing resumes, so focus on clarity and impact.Step 5: Preparing for the interviews ​The interview process often consists of several stages including automated psychometric test, coding round, technical test and live interviews which also has coding, technical and behavioral round.To prepare for coding rounds practice in leetcode. Try to solve all of the leetcode 150 problems even if they seem easy. Also see how others solve those problems. To prepare for technical round revise topics like OOP, DSA, Database, OS, Networking. System design related topic are a bit rare for freshers.Again, contact your seniors to learn more about the stages and question patterns.I actually compiled questions that we faced during our placement for juniors. Later others started contributing too. I will highly recommend to go through the site. It is my final gift to you. You can find the site link at https://github.com/TamimEhsan/interview-questions-bangladesh.Step 6: Final stage ​If you’re fortunate enough to secure multiple job offers, consider the following factors to make an informed decision: Salary and benefits, Location and commute. For example, I personally prefer a lower-paying job with an easier commute over a higher-paying one with a stressful commute.Most of the time you don’t need to negotiate your salary. However, it’s important to have realistic expectations and be prepared to justify them with valid reasons. Discuss your benefits, leaves, salary structure, bonuses, performace evaluation before you join any company. Remember, no company can force you to sign papers which prohibits you to stay for a x amount of time.Step 7: What if Things Don’t Work Out ​At first majority of you won’t get any placements right away. It will be even more frustrating when you will see that some of you are getting selected in multiple places. Do not create any conflicts for that. Avoid conflicts over this—it’s normal for candidates to choose what’s best for them. Once they make their choice, vacancies will open up for the next set of applicants.Don’t lose hope if you don’t find a job immediately. No one in BUET CSE remains unemployed for more than 3 months.If you’re still struggling reach out to your seniors for advice. Discuss areas where you might be lacking and identify ways to improve. Remember, you can always work on yourself and develop for the better.Final Note ​Best of luck to all of you! If you need help, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care.
